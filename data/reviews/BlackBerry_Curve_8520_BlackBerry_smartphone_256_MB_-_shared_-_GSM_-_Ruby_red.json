The touchpad is a nice upgrade over most blackberries, you wouldn't believe how apparently easy it is to take the trackbakk out of a blackberry (I've seen numerous floor models without their trackball, due to people abusing them)! You can even connect your blackberry to your PC and us it as a modem, which is pretty cool! You can also convert your videos using the blackberry software and put it on your phone! The QWERTY keyboard is actually quite nifty to have, and the battery life is a little bit above average.Cons: Sadly there's been times where the keypad or trackball wouldn't make their beeping noises (you can turn this feature on and off). The logo on the battery compartment isn't built as a tough (it's been about a month since I've had mine and only ONE part of the blackberry logo is still on there, and the imprints are still there).. the Internet is sometimes slow on this device, and some webpages don't display properly. for what it's worth, if you turn the wi-fi on, it seems to work faster, depending on connection.

For everyone else that wants a superior e-mail/messenger smartphone that just works, read on. So for starters this is the successor to the Curve 83XX series but it is no longer a middle of the road device but a more focused themed Blackberry in line with the rest of the collection. Much like the Storm and Flip are for specific audiences so is this device despite the fact it looks like the 8900. This phone is for the person who needs something smarter than a \"dumbphone\" yet not quite a smart device. While true a BB is a smart phone, it doesn't act like it. At the top of the phone there are media control features, a first for a BB. I must say they work very well and as advertised for easy access to the media player. Music sounds great and videos look pretty good though the screen is a bit small in resolution. Text and e-mail look great on the device, the internet and videos, not so much. It isn't bad, but definately not a selling point. What does sell the device is the superb e-mail and messaging features along with the great, yet somewhat click-y feeling keyboard. In a way it feels somewhat cheap but it functions and I had absolutely feeling I was going to break it and that goes for the rest of the rest of the device.

With a touchscreen, newly designed multimedia player and a 3.2-megapixel camera, it was a step away from the straight-laced business philosophy that people were used to from the Canadian manufacturer.Now, RIM has introduced another more consumer-focused, lower cost device in the form of the 8520 Curve.Although this latest device doesn't feature a touchscreen, there is a newly designed touch sensitive navigation button, situated in the centre below the screen. This takes the place of the Pearl, one aspect of the BlackBerry we've become accustomed to.This optical trackpad is successful at re-inventing a way to navigate around the BlackBerry - allowing you to scroll smoothly through menus. Like the Pearl, you can press down on the trackpad to select an item. For those people who have been using a BlackBerry with a Pearl, it may take a little time to get used to the experience, but soon you'll find it's more responsive.On either side of this navigation feature, there's the usual BlackBerry key that pulls up a content-specific menu, depending on which app you're using, and a back key on the right hand side. On the outer edges, you'll find call answer and end buttons. All four of these keys are recessed, giving the Curve 8520 a super-sleek finish.However, this sleek, shiny finish does come with a foible.

Previous cheap Nokia had a flashlight which came in handy. If this had a flash I could get a software flashlight function. I find this to be a bigger problem than lack of flash on camera, per se. 3.

It's smooth, sensitive, and responds just the way you want it to. -The phone itself is slim, a lot smaller than my pre and other blackberries I have used in the past. The rugged edges on the side places a firm grip on the phone so dropping it won't be as easy, and also there are multimedia functions on the top such as play, rewind, fast forward for media applications. -Streams videos such as youtube... and other miscellaneous sites ;], in good resolution as well.

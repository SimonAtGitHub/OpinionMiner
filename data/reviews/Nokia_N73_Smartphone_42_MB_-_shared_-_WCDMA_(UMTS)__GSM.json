[{"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Probably the best convergence of technologies in a very compact and easy to hold package. The camera is superb and rivals that of my dedicated digital cameras. Unfortunately, the responsiveness of the camera is pretty slow, the shutter lag is long and the autofocus takes a while, but if you can anticipate your shots its no problem. The LED flash actually works pretty well too. The camera has a nice sliding cover to protect the lens and turns on the camera function when you open it. If you update to the latest 4.x firmware, you get the Music Edition audio player with album art support. Battery life is very good with pretty moderate to heavy use. Stereo speakers are loud and sound good with 3D ringtone effects and widening effects. Menus are responsive and the screen is gorgeous and fairly large. 20megs of ram free at boot up. Stability is great, I ve installed a ton of programs and haven t had a lockup yet. Syncs perfectly with Outlook and PC Suite is probably the best bluetooth connection interface (compared to Activesync). 2gb mini SD cards work fine, but there are rumors that 4gb mini SDHC cards will work too. Then you have an iPhone killer for half the price. Only things missing are 3G, wifi, and qwerty or at least bigger keys...but then I guess you would get the N95 instead."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Many moons ago, I bought a W810i. It was brilliant. It also got dropped in water. Insurance sent me various flavors of braindead and broken phones (Pearl 8100, Samsung SGH-a707, W580i, LG Shine CU720) before office of the President stepped in and gave me $200 to buy this phone. It beats them all. PROS: It runs a real smartphone OS, which means real applications and real PDA functionality. The camera is fantastic. Pictures are crisp and vibrant. Video could be passed off as coming from one of those \"Flip Video\" sort of cameras. The media player flat-out makes sense. It's easy to use, lets you send it to the background, and holding a button (with the most recent firmware) immediately brings up the 'Now Playing'. Battery life has not been a problem. It's not quite the ten days my old W810i managed, but it's by no means bad. I use it moderately and charge it every third day. Charging is incredibly quick. At the maximum brightness the screen is uncomfortably bright, which is a very good thing. In the Nokia tradition, RF, signal acquisition and holding, and voice quality are stellar. Calls are loud and clear, and my mom can't be convinced I'm not on a landline. The speakers on the top are loud and clear. CONS: The keyboard is a bit cramped, but I'm used to that sort of thing. The joystick is a bit low-rent. The front camera is dreadful, but you already knew that. It uses Nokia's smaller, spindlier charging connector (but comes with an adapter - don't bin that old charger just yet) and"}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "This is the first smartphone that can really replace my iPaq pocketpc. I own this device 6 weeks and it is great. The size of the device is just within the maximum limits to be able to carry it in the pocket. (I find the N80 a little too bulky) Reception and sound quality outstanding. In combination with the Bluetooth Nokia carkit CK7W it works superbe. Hardly noise and no echo. As an MP3 player this can absolutely compete with my iPod (unfortunately MiniSD Cards do not come in bigger than 2 Gb yet). Screen is superb with QVGA. Finally it is usefull with TomTom GPS software. Multitasking works flawlessly. When I am using TomTom with the bluetooth GPS receiver, I can answer any phonecall in between (even with my CK7W bluetooth carkit). Keyboard is OK. In some reviews it was reported as troublesome but I find it good to work with. The camera is fairly good. It is the best quality I have ever seen in a smartphone. However, startup is very slow and in poor light conditions the picture quality is poor. Do not expect too much of the flash. A few not-so-good points. The Email application is crap. I cannot even delete messages. The same applies to the calendar application. (The default Calendar applications on Palm and PocketPc are crap as well).

I was dissapointed that the camera was not nearly as sharp as my very tiny, 2.0mp Sony camera. The gallery mode is awesome! The size is pretty nice. It is almost the exact dimensions of a SLVR (but twice as thick). The biggest issue is that I still get those annoying 'out of memory' warnings that I got on my 6682.

It lasts a very long time. Calls, text, mms, internet and it goes and goes. I had gotten used to charging my phones every day to every other day. The N73 can go 3 days easy wit med/heavy use on a charge. Second is the camera. The best shots I have ever seen on a phone. Auto focus is great. No blurry pic's and the flash gets it right. Here is one reason I picked the N73 over the D900. I have a 2 and 1/2 year old. Hard for her to stay still for a picture. The shutter lag on the D900 always made the shot blurry. On the N73, even though both phones have autofocus, the N73's shots come out clear and crisp. Can't figure out why, but the camera is worth the price. As far as Nokia's UI, its near the top of the phone list with Sony. You can do anything with the UI on the N73. Saves pic's to the mem card. Plays MP3's as rigtones, FULL Mp3's not making you cut them down and save to the phones mem, like the D900. I could go on and on. Yes, the D900 is super slim super cool slider phone with a 3 mega pixel camera. But it will frustrate you in a few days because of its limitations. Get the N73, and yes you will feel it bump around a bit in your shorts, but evertime you pull it out to use it, the phone that is. It will be great.

The Nokia N73 does allow be to do all that but since it is an unlocked phone I have no obligation to be signed up for such services. To be more specific about the actual phone, I am really fond of the phone s sleek look and design. Since I do love taking pictures, the phone is excellent in taking very high quality pictures as opposed to a typical pixelated cell phone picture as well allowing me to have manual control over the exposure of pictures. It has great reception and unburdening due to its size. It s very user friendly in terms of its ability to handle both PC and mac programs. One down side about the phone but it seems not too much trouble at all for me is the fact that it takes a second or two to go in between programs when they are running at the same time.

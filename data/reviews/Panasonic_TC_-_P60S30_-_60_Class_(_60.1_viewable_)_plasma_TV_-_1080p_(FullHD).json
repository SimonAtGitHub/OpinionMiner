It was a consumer reports recommended buy in November/Dec 2011. While the picture does not pop like LCD displays I appreciate the softer and more natural looking picture it delivers. HD Cable and Blu-Rays look fantastic. Football games show no blurring. I have only used a surround sound set-up since day one so I cannot comment on the TV speakers. Theonly thing that keeps this TV from getting a 5 rating is that sometimes it flickers. Some bright displays flicker to a darker screen. It is quick but you do notice it. It seems more prominent on things like basketball highlights. Some days/shows you don't see it at all. It may be some type of auto contrast setting that I will play with as I tweak the calibration.

If they want a brighter screen/lighter colors, they should go buy an LCD/LED.Actual use:Movie buffs and Bluray addicts will LOVE this TV. Truly a theatre like experience in the home. The Graininess ppl talk about gives the image a \"pull down screen\" effect, again like in the theatres (some like this, some dont). Playing games look great with very little to non-existent motion blur, but is not recommended as its main use (even with the burn in prevention/solutions they have built in now). Watching sports will offer deep/dark colors, games at night may at times be hard to see the background (especially in baseball, but the clairty of the players is amazing).Features:"}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: picture quality, sizebought this TV for an absolutely incredible price. got it delivered the day before superbowl.Having bought a panasonic TC-P50X1 plasma 2 years ago from BB, I knew plasmas had a great picture. I never liked LED/LCDs since the picture washes out if you're not exactly in front of the TV. I see that on all LED TVs at all screen sizes. The X1 always amazed me with its beautiful picture though it is a low end model. Now its going into the bedroom. The P60S30 didnt disappoint either. It's picture is beautiful and B-I-G. Sound is average; I use the TV speakers for Uverse, and home theater for bluray/dvd. I noticed with some channels the speakers crackle slightly if the volume is raised beyond 40, but thats a minor issue IMO. Here are the settings that worked for me.HDTV (Uverse) contrast +78, bright +58, CATS off, Color temp normal, all others default. REsolution set to 1080i on Uverse box.Bluray: contrast +78, bright +58, CATS off, Color temp Warm 1, all others default.dvd (component): same as blurayI did not purchase the extended warranty since my amex card extends the mrfs warranty by 1 year.

It is requiring me to by pass the TV and run an additional cable to the receiver from the source. Not a major show stopper, but very inconvienent to have to bring out the other remotes and switch the source all the time.

I hooked my blue ray player up to it and it puts out a great picture. The sound (as on most flat screens) is not that great but if you are watching in a quiet room its tolerable. I will be buying a surround sound system though. Here is the issue. I have a first generation XBOX 360 which originally came with the component hook ups. My XBOX has worked perfectly on every tv I have ever hooked it up to (6 different televisions). When I went to hook it up to the tv for the first time, it would not pick up a signal from either the component input or the audio/video input. I had three people who are a little more technology savvy than I am take a look at it to no avail. When I hooked my Blue Ray player up to it I found that the left speaker was busted (fresh out of the box on the first day that I had it).

It was mainly the price that sold me on the product since but the screen size was also a great advantage. Like I was always told, go big or you will regret it later.

This TV connects to Netflix, Facebook, Pandora, among others...except Youtube. Nice bonus if you ask me. I found this TV advertised cheaper on another website and BB price matched it!

Blacks are blacks, images are sharp, colors are naturally vibrant.2. It's a really good value. I don't need 3d. There's too less content out there right now. You will need a separate dongle for wifi but you can simply attach a LAN cable. It's still a smart TV but if you have a wifi blu ray player such as PS3s, wifi TVs don't have much use.3. The look isn't as pretty as Samsungs. It's pretty dated. But I watch the screen more than the bezel. You don't get a blu-ray disc and watch the design of your tv.4. I don't care about TV speakers.

This thing is HUGE!! I was looking to buy a new TV which I have not done since 1996 when we got married and bought a 27 inch Zenith analog . I also have a Samsung 42 inch LCD that was given to me as a gift. I was sold on buying an LED, then my father-in-law got me looking at Plasma. I looked beyond the hype and trend and looked at the picture and the plasma for me just looks more natural and definitely better with high speed sports and gaming. Very interesting because he has a new Sharp 60 inch LED. This TV overcomes many of the old plasma problems. It has a new pixel screen which limits the old Glare issues. If you look at a light in the room off the screen, it looks dull and pixel-ed much like an LED screen. It has a built in screen saver which limits chance of burn in. The one thing I would say is that picture quality is definitely related to level of resolution of the input. One HD channel looks great and then the next is not HD and it doesn't look that great. I think it does natural pictures better and I've seen computer generated stuff look a little more clear on LEDs, but again for me it goes back to a natural look.

I turned off the smooth motion setting but I still was not impressed. I decided to sell my LED at a great price. Oh and you should probably know that I am very picky with tv performance in the last 6 years I have had 9 different sets ranging from the early Mitsubishi LED projection as welll as 3D DLP, various LCD's and one LED. I had always been very hesitant when it came to plasma due to what I had heard about life span, burn in, and lacking brightness. Well I can say I am absolutely in love with my 60 inch Panny plasma. You need to realize that when plasmas first came out they did not have the technology they have now to stop burn in and did not have the life span they do now. This tv is rated at 100000 hrs before it loses 50% of brightness! That is amazing! I have LCDs that have about 30 to 50k on them and I can honestly say the picture is not what it was new.

Whether its watching tv, sports, playing video games, dvd's or blu-rays this tv is awesome. It was a cake walk to set up(by myself) and very easy to hook up all of my components to. Also, just a reminder, I have Direct TV and the cable box wasn't set up to receive 1080i when it was installed, only 480i. Double check to make sure that your cable box is receiving 1080i or you'll obviously think something is wrong with your new tv. At any rate, the viewing angle is phenomenal so there isnt a bad seat in the house. I can't wait to watch the Super Bowl on this thing. The only drawback, and it really isnt one, is that the hdmi, usb component hook ups are on the far right hand side of the back of the tv and not in the middle. It wasn't a big problem, just need to make sure you hjave long enough wires to connect your toys to the tv. This is a terrific tv, and for the price you can't beat it.

The black colors appear to be very accurate. The skin tones appear very accurate as well. LED's and LCD's are great televisions as well, however they cannot produce the realism a plasma does.

The menu controls are very easy to use, and I found that simply setting the display to \"Game Mode\" makes everything look great. Sports and action scenes are displayed superbly. I wouldn't use the 3D feature even if this TV had it (in my opinion, either 3D is a fad, or the technology will evolve into something actually worthwhile--but for now it's garbage). And as for the lack of an internet connection, if you really want that, it's probably better to access the net through a laptop or internet ready dvd player (I find using my laptop with a full keyboard much more comfortable). The built in sound quality is ok for someone who doesn't like a strong theater sound. If you turn the volume up too much, it will start to sound a little distorted, but if you're turning it up that high, you probably want a home theater system anyway (good way to use the Reward Zone coupons you got from buying the TV).

Of course, plasma TVs work better in dimly-lit rooms (not in over-lit rooms/stores). This Panny has a 600HZ refresh rate, so NO motion blur like on some LCD's (sports like: NBA, NHL, NFL, MLB look just amazing on this Panny Plasma). In my honest opinion (and most other videophile's opinions) a plasma HDTV is far superior to a LCD or LED-LCD in many ways. Plasma's are FASTER, have a more \"true to life\" picture (not hyper-reality/over saturated picture like most LCD/LED-LCD's) and have a WIDE viewing angle perfect for rooms that people sit off to the sides.

My husband had been researching TVs for as long as I can remember and was sold on a Sharp Aquos Quattron LED (120Hz). He had heard some negative things about it, such as blurring during sports and other fast-paced activities so he wanted to check it out in the store. Am I glad he did - that TV was nothing compared to this S30 by Panasonic. All reviews online for plasma TVs raved about the newer plasma technology, the better blacks, the brighter colors, the ability to watch sports without blurring (due to the 600Hz). The hubs immediately forgot the Sharp, but was undecided between the awesome 55\" VT30 and this excellent 60\" S30 - but what swayed us towards the S30 was the lack of 3D (honestly, we were just never going to watch it) and the price difference - the VT30 was $2000 on sale, and the S30 was $1100. Because this TV was so affordable, we were about to purchase awesome tower speakers. The ONLY negative on this TV - the speakers aren't great - it sounds as if you are traveling in a tunnel... not ideal for such a great picture. Our new speakers really bring out the sound and weren't overpriced like other stores. All-in-all, a great purchase at a great price.

I wished that all 3 HDMI outputs were on the side of the TV. I used a slim mount and having 2 of the 3 HDMI outputs on the back of the TV slightly gets in the way of the wall and the tilting mount.Want to connect the TV to my wireless network, but the wireless adapter is sold separately.Great TV for it's price and make sure you buy the proper mount as this TV is pretty heavy.

The sound through the internal speakers is ok, but sounds great on a surround sound system. The picture quality is great especially if you have HD. I tried to watch a movie off the flash drive last night but found out that it did not support AVI movies (I will have to look more into that) which is a bummer. The sales people at hhgregg were very professional and helped me through the sale and even gave me a discount.

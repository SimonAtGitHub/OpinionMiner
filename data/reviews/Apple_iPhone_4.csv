1/3/2012 11:47:40,"Dretlaw",5,"Pros: Awesome smart phone with access to hundreds of fun and useful apps.
Existing iPhone users should not have any problems figuring out how to use this new phone. The phone has now improved with the additional of a front-facing camera for ""face time."" I especially like the brighter and clearer screen thanks to retina display. I haven't tried the video editing and sharing yet, but I am glad to know it's available. It will come handy for when I go on vacation. Most of all, what's an iPhone without the iPod function and bluetooth. Works wirelessly well with my '10 Mazda's built-in bluetooth radio, no cables needed. Being able to multitask also while in the middle of a call is a useful function. Longer battery life ensures that you can be on the phone or text for longer periods of time. If you have the initial unlimited data, you get to keep it. Lastly, I have access to hundreds and hundreds of apps through iTunes.
Unfortunately, it is not perfect. I am one of those customers who suffers from loss of signal if the phone is held via the black strip. Fortunately, with the iPhone case program (offer ends 9-30-10), I was able to get a free case which has helped reduce the contact with the black antenna strip. Hopefully, Apple will improve on this. I may return this phone, because I am still holding off for a white one. Otherwise, its an awesome phone. "
1/3/2012 11:59:23,"justinakaboss",5,"I bought the iPhone 4 as a replacement for my old BlackBerry Curve and it was like someone handed me an ice cold glass of water after crawling through a hot desert. It has everything that I want and need, and nothing i don't.
The design of the phone is just gorgeous. The glass on the front and the back is engineered to be 30x's harder than plastic. This combined with the high grade steel frame create a durable scratch resistant package.
When you turn the phone on, the first thing you notice is the clarity of the display. You cannot see the pixels on the screen unless you literally hold it an inch from your eyes. The 5 megapixel camera takes stunning photos that look crystal clear on the display. The colors are very accurate for a phone camera. The ""tap to focus"" is also a nice feature.
Another thing I noticed right away is how quickly apps loaded compared to my 2nd generation iPod Touch. Apps that took up to 30 seconds to load on my iPod load almost instantly on the iPhone 4. With all of these great capabilities, I was afraid that the battery might not be able to keep up, but the battery life is phenomenal. My battery lasts between 2-4 days depending on how much I use it.
One of the biggest selling points for me was the seamless connectivity with iTunes. All I had to do was plug it onto my computer and it automatically synced my music library, videos, contacts, and all the apps that were previously on my iPod touch.
The 6 axis gyroscope adds a whole new dimension to gaming apps. Just like the accelerometer, the gyroscope is very accurate. One thing I realized though is that the gyroscope doesn't work well in the car. When the car goes around a corner, your game goes off the screen! (Well you shouldn't be playing games while driving anyway).

1/3/2012 12:02:08,"Marinewife7264",3,"Pros: nice new look, camera options
Cons: doesnt have good signal for calls or text
I bought the iphone 4 about a month ago. I previously owned the iphone 3Gs.
Cons: I have to say I'm a little disappointed with the new one. The calls are horrible! I'm constantly dropping calls even with the case and I often cant even make calls out. Same with sending and receiving text messages. I don't really like that you can't use the face time (video calls) with the 3g network, you have to be connected to wifi. Also the battery life isnt that much better then the 3Gs.
Pros: I do like a few new features though. I really like that you can switch the camera mode to face you. It really helps if your trying to take a picture of yourself. I also like that they added a light for the camera. I do like the feature of creating folders. It allows me to download more apps and keep them organized.
Overall I think that its a really cool concept but it is a phone and the fact that I can hardly make or receive 70% of my calls and text is a really disappointment!! Its basically used just for the apps and camera at the moment. I would say that I would not recommend this to a friend only based on the fact of the reception. If they happen to fix the problem then I would recommend this to everyone because it would be a great phone!!!! "
1/3/2012 12:04:12,"AK49er",3,"I liked this ok, calls were decent, but I returned it because after seeing some really high end Androids, and the Android line up that's coming in 2011 alone, it suddenly looked too small & too plain. Really clear screen but 3.5 is just tiny. I love media, and watching Netflix or other video was cramped, and browsing the web was cumbersome. I found myself scrolling a lot because of it's small screen. After a short while It just looked like a touch phone with sliding screens and app squares- nothing more. Wish they could add character, make the waste of space bezels above the screen, and below, more useful. (Like maybe make it a ""4 screen at the minimum.) I loved the apps, but there's just something about a phone with screen character that's more appealing to me. I like being able to see the weather at a glance, see my daily/weekly schedule and tasks right on the screen. These things are supposed to be PDA/smartphones right? Then more Personal Digital Assistance would be nice. I shouldn't have to go inside certain apps just to see the important things. I want those things in my face at a glance. Seeing clips of my texts, emails, facebook, and twitter updates, also right there on the screen, would be an added bonus- that's nice too. I work from my phone and I get mass text messages, so another thing that I hated was having to delete all my text messages 1 at a time. What's that all about? A ""Delete All"" option has been around since the dawn of texting. Also hated the fact that I couldn't choose what numbers I wanted to delete in the recent call list. It was all or nothing. I used it heavily, so I was constantly having to charge it. I could have purchased a battery charging case, but I like thin phones. Switching out the battery is way nicer. I can have one charging at all times, then I can simply just swap it out and go. "
1/3/2012 12:05:02,"Obiwan74",5,"Pros: Beautiful Display, Fast Processor, Wifi-N support, Feels solidly built
Cons: Afraid to scratch screen, Facetime is a potential cool feature, Nightly re-charges recommended
I'm not an Apple fanboy but I have owned the original 2G, the 3G, the 3GS and now the iPhone4. I have owned it for over a month now and couldn't part with it. It seems odd to talk about the aesthetics of a phone but the screen resolution is incredible and it feels balanced and sturdy when you hold it. I haven't had any issues with the antenna - the only reception problems I have had are just related to the one dead-zone near where I live. It's also noticeably faster than the 3GS and it supports wireless-N networks. Battery life is improved over the 3G/3GS but you'll still want to re-charge it nightly. The big issue I have is that I'm afraid to get it scratched but I highly recommend Powersupport's Combo Film Set for the iPhone4 which covers both the front and back. Facetime looks cool but I don't know too many people that have an iPhone to actually use it. "
1/22/2012 22:40:29,TechMan2010,5,"Pros: Battery Life, Screen Resolution, Design, Camera, Multitasking
Cons: Nothing
iPhone 4 is the best iPhone release to date. Touting an improved camera, 720p video recording, voice commands, new design, and better screen resolution.
Best of all is the battery life. Lasts twice as long as the 3G, especially after the new ios4.2
Of course the phone is missing flash, animated backgrounds, and voice gps but its other features and reliability make it the best in the market.
I have never had dropped calls! "
1/22/2012 22:44:17,y2klemson,4,"Pros: Seamless switch from iPhone 3G, solid construction, beautiful display
Cons: Proximity sensor, camera white balance in fluorescent light
Everything has worked great on the new phone. The screen is amazingly sharp and colorful. Apps optimized for the higher resolution look very very nice. I use my old 3G for some hobby stuff and you can definitely see the difference. You can also feel the difference -- the 4 is so much faster.
I've had issues with the proximity sensor which the firmware update didn't correct. Maybe it's my greasy face, but I consistently press touchscreen buttons while on a call -- and I'm not holding the phone with my shoulder, either. The camera is very nice, but the flash leaves some things to be desired. My AT&T experience has remained relatively good and fairly priced. The voice control feature is very limited, especially when compared to Android-based phones.
The nice thing is this: the hardware is terrific, but the software could use more polish/features"
1/22/2012 23:00:41,Android42019,5,"Pros: Its everything you need in one phone for the great price
Cons: Face Time requires WiFi and other iPhone 4 Users
This phone, out of all the phones ive had is by far the best. The new retina display is actually what its been made out to be. the clarity of the 5mp camera on the back is great for taking pictures of mail letters, you can actually see the letters sharply instead of a blurry word. The flat back makes it less bulky for pocket travel compared to the old oval shape of the 3G/S. The LED light is much better than the flashlight apps. The cam on the front is decent but not quite as clear as i thought it would be. Face Time would be great if i could find a friend with an iphone4, downside is, you have to be connected to WiFi. I myself have not experienced any problems such as the Display color or Reception ive only had 3 or 4 dropped calls since i got mine last month, ive had more problems with my 3GS as far as dropped calls go. Battery life is moderate depending on what you do with it all day. The HD video recording isgreat, along with Hulu+ coming soon it will be even better being able to watch FULL HD shows on the go for $9.99/month, some say not worth it but i disagree. This is the ULTIMATE phone for those who like Apple+Touch screen's with a QWERTY keyboard. Apple has come a LONG way since the first iphone with a max of 8GB capacity, no send/recieve mms, and a Metal backing that dents in your pocket all for a whopping $600."
1/22/2012 23:12:01,kells19,2,"It's tough to say which is worse, the phone from apple or the service from at&t. The phone freezes too much, has issues with backing up on itunes and has issues with re-sizing screen images. At&t is just horrible, terrible service. I am on Edge network more than 3G which makes web browsing and apps almost impossible to use and I have trouble connecting calls and get dropped about 20% of the time, very frustrating. I had the 3GS phone and wish I would have never upgraded, no value and no benefit. It also means I have a new 2 year agreement with at&t which was a mistake. I have every apple product on the market and several of their new ones are disappointing, most recently this phone and the new ipod touch. I will be cautious with all apple purchases going forward. "
1/22/2012 23:16:49,CMc2 ,1,"Pros: nothing
Cons: everything
Battery has to be charged every evening, can't access app's, drops calls or fades out, sometimes it doesn't ring, just vibrates, takes good pictures but I have a nice camera for that, if I hadn't signed a 2 yr contract I would cancel and go back to a cheap phone without all the extra unusable garbage. "
1/22/2012 23:25:18,Mustang88 ,3,"At first I reallllllly loved it. I think i liked it more for show and bragging rights than really ""liking"" it. After awhile It would drop a ton of calls. Alllllllll the time. Texting was kind of a pain in the rear because the letters are so close together. I didnt like how I had to purchase ringtones through itunes either. I usually use one of those free sites and with this phone you cant do that or get any sort of music forwarded to you and save it. I LOVED the camera. I have a 4 year old and took professional quality pictures with this phone..esp after downloading the free photoshop app. I didnt like how most of the apps cost at least $1.99 or the free ones would be demos. I was dissipointed in that. The speaker at first was amazing but it seemed like after 2 weeks it went way down. The battery life isnt bad for how much i used it. The main things I used was the facebook app and maps but they froze alot and i found myself re-downloading them a lot."
1/22/2012 23:27:45,boomergeek,4,"Pros: Screen, battery, camera
Cons: Shape, antenna problem, extra ATT cost for tethering
iPhone 4 is a well-functioning phone, with the proper case. It has a much better battery life than the 3GS, but this was a low bar. Screen is clearer, processor functions very well, and reception is a bit better that the 3GS. I thought the 3GS rounded shape was actually sleeker and fit in the hand better, but nonetheless I find the 4 more useful because of the better camera, 2nd camera, and battery life. Would have like tethering, but ATT wouldn't let me keep the unlimited plan and tether it. "
1/22/2012 23:30:37,ogrevolc,4,"Pros: camera, responsive touchscreen, tons of apps
Cons: no am/fm receiver, custom ringtones are hard to make (and the stock ringtones suck), programs stay signed in
All in all, this was a good purchase. The interface is intuitive, and the touchscreen in very responsive. The camera is amazing and I love the feature for taking self-portraits. There are tons of apps available for any i-phone user, and lots of them are free. I don't like that there is no radio receiver in the phone (it's only in the ipod nano?) and the ring tones that are stock on the phone are not anything I'd prefer. Also, programs automatically stay signed in until you physically select the ""logout"" command, which makes me wonder what's eating up data when I don't realize it..."
1/22/2012 23:45:56,akiraraptor ,5,"Pros: Great functions, good price, top phone
Cons: Love to see user expandable memoryI feel the iPhone has the best set of features and functions in the smart phone arena. Ease of use, abundant amount of apps available, and and best design come together to make one of the best smartphones I've ever used.
I upgraded to the iPhone 4 on day one. I still feel the same about this phone as I do my first. And with the new features and functions of the 4, it just keeps getting better.
Now, I can't say it's perfect. I've had a few dropped calls, but no more than my 3G, and really, no more than any other phone I've owned. So, I'd say it performs basically the same as others.

I don't have any issues with AT&T, so I have no complaints. I've used all the other carriers over the years and I like ATT the best.They made a great product and it shows.
Specifically on the iPhone 4, the screen is out of this world. You have to see it and compair it to really understand the difference from this phone and all other phones on the market. The dual cameras are great, and the new flash is a welcome addition. The v ideo is great and in HD as well. Plus all the built in functions that allow you to make a video and then send it directly to YouTube is cool."

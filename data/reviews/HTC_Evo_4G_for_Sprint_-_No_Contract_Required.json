I have had to go it to recieve a new battery 12 times because it will stop turning on. It also dies within two hours if you are a heavy app user. Me myself, I'm not, but when I would it would die. You have to carry a charger with you during the day and have it plugged in all night, because the battery dies even without being touched for hours. I am 100% upset with the phone and do not advice anyone to buy it. It becomes a stress having to go into BB to get a new battery or a replacement phone so they can send it in, and when you get it back, it's no better.

Now I'm going to say in terms of design and functionality, I believe this phone is just better than the iPhone 4.

An example of the poor battery, When I was using my phone to play Angry Birds, while Wi-Fi and 4G was on, the battery went from 100% to 0% in less than 5 hours. Yeah, it's pretty bad.

I do like that I haven't had to wipe the phone down very often as I was thinking since it is a touchscreen phone, I thought that I would be wiping it down every 15 minutes. In fact, it seems I was wiping down my non-touchscreen BlackBerries more often than I did with this. Battery does tend to drain a little bit faster than phone that I am use to.

It takes two hands to scroll through your contacts. If you try to access information you wind up accidently making a call to someone to don\u0092t want to talk to.

Ok, I understand you might want to invoke security, but what about if you don\u0092t want to. The screen still locks and it\u0092s once again a two handed operation, unless you are at a desk or table.3. Battery life. You will be looking for receptacles everywhere. It becomes your lifeline. I don\u0092t want to carry charging cables with me anytime I leave the house. If you are an intense phone, text, application, or camera user, you\u0092ll be looking for a recharge several times a day. If you have minimal use, you will still need to recharge this every night.

While I do love my phone, there are several issues I didn't read about in reviews that would have influenced my decision. I'll only be addressing the problems I've encountered with the phone, since all the perks have been mentioned by other reviewers elsewhere. Two of the main reasons I chose the EVO over the Epic 4g were the video chat capabilities and the 8 mp camera. Unfortunately, 99% of phones out there don't have the video chat option yet, which makes it hard to find someone to video chat with. The camera, which is boasted as a prize for having 8 mp and hi-def capabilities, takes not-so-great pictures in low light situations, even with the flash. Since, I wanted the camera as an upgrade from my current Canon 3.2 mp, and most of the times I need to take photos are in a low light situation, this is a problem. My 3.2 mp Canon takes far superior quality photos. The EVO's camera shutter is pretty awkward to hit using one hand where it's situated, since the phone's a little on the heavy and large side.

I narrowed it down to either the EVO or the EVO Shift. Why was I considering the Shift ? because I was just scared of not having a keyboard. I struggled with my decision for weeks and researched various comments. I reviwed the pros and cons of each and thought that I came to a decision to get the Shift. I walked into BestBuy and held the two phones and knew there was no choice .. had to get this phone ( The EVO). The shift felt very flimsy and the keyboard was useless. I absolutely made the right choice. This phone is amazing ! The screen is awesome. I was concerned about it's size because I keep my phone in my pocket but it is the perfect size. No problem. I use my phone primarily for text, e-mail and checking social networks. This phone does it all. No problems setting up my e-mail accounts. The size of the screen lets you view facebook and videos and other images in full view. Just awesome ! There is no way the Shift can compare. The battery life is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. With a few minor changes it wil be fine. Besides, I ordered the extended battery over ebay and from what I hear it will keep the phone workiing for days. Coming from a Blackberry, there is no comparison. Welcome to the 21st century !!!

I've had the phone for about 3 months now and since the phone hasn't broken or become irritating, my initial thoughts still stand.First, the bad. From what you've most likely read, the battery life is at best, mediocre. If you use this phone, you have to change your habits when it comes to charging. If you're like me, this hasn't been very hard: plug the phone in at my desk at work, then plug it in again at night before I go to sleep. If I miss either of these charges, the phone will be dead. It becomes tricky when I'm out on the weekends and if I know I'm going to be away from a charger: I might just turn the phone off until I need to use it.Second: 4g is pointless. I have wi-fi all over my house and my office, so I will turn on wi-fi if I'm trying to download something heavy or watch youtube videos, but for normal browsing, 3g works fine. I live in the heart of Atlanta and can only get 1 bar of 4g and it takes a while to log on to the service anyway.

I recently upgraded this phone two weeks ago so i could do a thorough review. This phone is very fast compared to most phones and my last phone the hero. I find it is very easy to use and the touch screen is very responsive. The colors are vibrant on the screen and you can load most utube videos with ease. Some are still to big to download.The phone looks large. In fact a new iphone can practically fit in the screen of the evo. I found it is easier to hold when on the phone for a long period of time compared to smaller phones.One thing with this phone is the battery life. If you are on the internet constantly and talking for long periods of time the battery will last around 6 hours max . I highly recommend that you go to the interrnet and use the tips to save the battery life. I go on Facebook for awhile and text and talk most of the day and it usually lasts about 10 hours or more. It is good to get to know your phone and its settings as it will drain battery life like a computer. If you turn things off and on when you need them it will last quite a while.

Plenty of other reviews extol the features, apps and virtues of this phone, so I won't here. What I will review is what I don't like about the phone, which aren't too many things, but unfortunately, they are the biggest and most important things. This review involved 2 new Sprint EVO 4G cellphones. I had to rate the cellphone itself as 4 stars, Good because of the battery life. If I were to rate coverage as well, it would drop down to 1 star, poor. But this is the cellphone review, and if you live in a well covered Sprint area, especially, in a 4G area, it could be conceivably be rated 5 stars, excellent, if you aren't that concerned with the battery recharging. So on to the review.1. The battery life for the EVO 4G SUCKS BIG TIME. You will typically have to recharge it every night, maybe more depending whether you use the Bluetooth, WiFi, GPS & 4G functions, especially if you run them all at the same time for any extended period of time. Now, let it be known, that this is not limited just to the EVO. It appears to be typical of most all advanced Android phones, so it may well become just a way of life in general. Just be aware, that an AC charger and an in-car charger will likely become an absolutely necessity.By the way, be sure that your in-car charger is rated for +5V at 1 amp DC output, NOT"}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "The EVO is fun to use and does more than I will ever ask of it except print from my phone.

I chose to purchase my EVO from Best Buy, instead of Sprint, because I did not have to deal with rebate offers (which normally take six to eight weeks to get), I got my discount right on the spot with Best Buy.

It is quite fast on 3G and blazing fast on 4G. I have no problem hearing my calls and I've not dropped any calls yet. However, make certain to buy an extended battery for this phone or you'll be dissatisfied with the battery life. There are currently two extended battery options (both are available at Bust Buy) and I chose the largest battery. Even with the extended battery, the phone still fits in the front pocket of my jeans and I haven't yet run the battery all the way down. I was visiting family in a rural area for two weeks during Christmas. I had to use the phone's wi-fi hotspot to run my iPad for extended periods while I was there and even then the battery never died on me.My only two complaints--and they are very minor--are:1) There is no \"Words With Friends\" app available in the Android Market yet, so I still have to play it on my iPod.2) I can't seem to find a skin that will fit my phone with the extended battery on it.I've been hoping that Sprint would eventually be able to sell the iPhone.

It was the best decision I made. The EVO as it stands now, ( 4G coverage in my area and Froyo) is at it's peak! It's sleek, fast, and the 4.3 in. display is breath-taking! I use it as a replacement for my ipod and to keep in constant contact with all my friends through the friend stream which links all social networks into one place. And now with the kindle app from the Android market I don't have to buy a separate device to keep my reading list current and within a fingers reach.Despite all of these things that it can do and do very well, there is one negative. This negative however, is easily remedied. The EVO is a battery hog and the factory one is just not up to par. Expect to charge it constantly. At least until you purchase an extended life battery from Seidio. You can pick it up for between $50-$60 and it'll be the best money you've ever spent! Since purchasing that amazing accessory my battery life has gone from pooch to beast! It can go over two whole days with heavy use between charges. The factory gets you a couple of hours between tops!Some people will say what about the Epic or the new EVO shift?

Since I work as an outside sales rep and use about 4000 minutes/month +roughly 10,000 texts, android apps, web, and email non-stop, I need something with incredible battery life. The EVO has been surprisingly good with respect to battery life. The phone itself is decent, the only downside being that it really, really needs 4G to run at its best. However, when you use 4G (If you're lucky enough to be in the TINY coverage area where it's currently available), your battery life is cut by almost 30% vs. 3G. I'm still baffled by the fact that cell phone manufacturers are still sacrificing battery life to keep the weight down on a phone. Honestly, I expect that a phone that can do as much as the EVO and which has a screen the size of the EVO, will weigh more than my blackberry, and I'm OK with that. All I want is a phone that will last through an entire workday without a charge. Is that really too much to ask? REALLY?To get down to the review here, if you're looking for an android based phone, the EVO is pretty much the best one Sprint's got for right now.

The screen is very responsive and among the best of the touch screens I have used. Composing text messages and e-mails is quick and efficient, especially when using Swype. The speaker is loud and sounds quite good. The web browsing experience is fast and emulates a small tablet. The phone dialer is effective, though it tends to lag at times. The kick stand is not much more than a cute gimmick.The battery life is poor. However, I am not complaining about it as I recognize that it is more than just a phone. Frankly, if you only need to make calls and send an occasional text, then the EVO is overkill. For example, I run the Sirius/XM app all through my work day, so the phone stays plugged in. However, on other days of typical use, it can go 15-16 hours and still have 30-40% charge.I went a little further than most, having rooted the phone and installing a custom ROM.

I was sticking with my simple flip phone and a PDA. I finally broke down and bought one, the EVO 4G. And, I am very impressed.I was initially horrified by the battery life. The first two days of me testing it would result in the battery fully draining in 4 hours (and no, it wasn't on the whole time). Turning off WiFi, 4G, Bluetooth and GPS made no difference. I then found a post on \"android forums\" titled \"battery tweaks\" that explained lots of things to do (mostly disabling or reducing the amount it would sync various apps). Plus, I learned that installing Advanced Task Killer was a bad thing to do, and that I had installed an app that had a severe bug - caused a continuous 100kB/s download that drained battery. Oops! Once I fixed all that, things just kept getting better.The screen looks beautiful and works really well, responding wonderfully to every tap, flick or pinch. I'm using a screen protector but it doesn't seem to harm the screen's use at all.I haven't used the camera much that faces me, but the other that is for taking pictures and video is very nice.

The first thing I will address with the Evo is the battery issue. I don't see where this is even an issue. The battery on the Evo, given it's capabilities and screen size, is absolutely 100 percent acceptable to me. Some people just do not understand how much juice a phone such as this requires. Just keep it charged and buy a car charger and one for the office and you're fine.Phone calls on Evo are very clear, even inside my home which is saying a lot. That was going to be a deal-breaker for my gf and I as we do not have a land line phone. The phone option is very accessible, as there is a large button that says \"phone\" on the home screen. Texting is another story. For the first couple of days, I hated texting on this phone because I was used to having a physical keyboard. I kept typing the wrong letter, and then had to go back to correct it. There is an auto-correct feature that helps as you\u0092re typing, but you can also disable all of that (which I did).The internet browser and processor are awesome.

My next favorite feature is the Voice Mail app. With it you never have to dial into Sprint somehow the file is sent to your phone where you can play it instantly.The browser is very good but possibly a little slower than expected even on WIFI but it is still very usable. Web pages look like real web pages instead of some condensed crammed version. Flash support is very nice but not all websites work correctly. These are normally sites that are 100% flash like a wedding photographer's site for example.There are some great apps for this phone like Pandora Radio and Direct TV Sunday Ticket. With Sunday Ticket I can watch any live Football game I want even on 3G and in the car. The video quality is pretty good too and I also have to mention Angry birds... love that game. Unfortunately there is no Netflix app yet. :(On to the bad things... Battery Life is pretty poor. The best I can get is 9 hours off the changer.

It's got nice big screen, it's lighting fast and android is becoming the best interface for customization and apps. What I want to explain is how I improved my battery life. I installed the \"advanced task killer\" and \"juice defender\" and using both along with decreasing the frequency that apps and widgets update themselves improved the battery life significantly. Another thing that strangely seemed to help was changing the screen brightness. I turned off the setting that automatically adjusts brightness and just turned it up to about 3/4 or more of the way up. Not only does it make the screen look much better (more like the iphone 4, btw) but it seemed to improve the battery life as well. I guess this might be because having it set to auto which is what the phone comes with keeps the light sensor on all the time which drains the battery, and setting it at a constant, brighter level is the more efficient option.

If you have this phone and aren't getting great battery life, run the HTC software update and make sure you're running the latest version of the operating system. You can also change the rate at which all the widgets you are using update themselves. If you set them to automatically update every four hours instead of every 30 minutes, you'll also see a large increase in battery life.

The plan was amazing and the service was great. However, like many people, after being locked into a very limited phone selection for that plan, I was lured by the iPhone and switched to AT&T.Though the iPhone is awesome (I hope Sprint gets it soon!), AT&Ts service was not up to par, especially at the premium the user pays to have the iPhone and the limited AT&T data plans. Voice calls would drop with full reception and I never figured out why. This location of drops would be different and the frequency kept increasing. Also, the voice quality was garbage. However, i will give credit to AT&T for fast data speeds, at least in my area.Even after trying the iPhone 4, which is also an awesome phone but had it's own issues (plus AT&Ts service), I decided it was worth paying the ETF and going back to Sprint.I tested the Evo 4G using the trial period and ported my number over.

I have to lock the screen then unlock it to get it to function again (and sometimes that doesn't work). Also, when I go to write a text message to someone, it has a tendency to bring up a \"conversation\" with another person, not the person that I originally clicked on. It gets frustrating when you're trying to send a quick message to someone then having to backtrack because the phone brought up the wrong person. I thought that it was honestly user error and I clicked on the wrong person by accident, but then it would bring up a contact that was much lower down on my list (so it wasn't like they were right next to each other and I pressed on the wrong one).

Short Battery lifeI spent weeks looking at the iphone and this HTC Evo. I used to have the 3g iphone, but it was time for an upgrade. This phone does it all.

The built in speaker is plenty loud and the video playback is amazing. At first the larger size and android apps took a little getting used to, but then I felt right at home and couldn't imagine going back to a smaller phone.The team at Best Buy did a great job of prepping the phone to make sure everything worked before I left the store.

And, if you aren't necessarily happy with any of them, it's very easy to change them out! Because of that same \"openness\" apps can access those core features of the phone, and aren't locked out.The market is growing everyday with brand new apps that never cease to amaze.The screen is large, with a higher pixel density. So, it's going to look sharper than most phone's screens.But, there is a weakness--the battery.If you use your phone pretty decently (having it on all day, picking it up and using it atleast once every 15-30 minutes), it's not going to last."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: Scalability and customization, clear call quality, fantastic camera, lightning fast multitasking, great GPSCons: Battery life could be just a tad better, apps sometimes don't uninstall when you hit \"Remove\"It took me three weeks to get this phone from Best Buy themselves, adding to that frustration was the fact that my previous phone, a pocket PC, decided to meet it's untimely death via a drop so I was without a phone during the entire time.

It's easier to type on and watch/read content. The front-facing camera is a great feature; I've used Fring and Qik to make video calls and have found this to work fairly well over both wifi and 3G.The thing I most appreciate about this phone is how customizable it is.

Sprint saves me a LOT over what Verizon would have cost - and I get more minutes with Sprint.

Coming to grips with the battery life on the EVO is something that has to be worked at - but in the end it's doable. First, you MUST run \"Advanced Task Killer' - set to aggressive - and run every 30 minutes. You need to be diligent about turning off stuff you don't need. That includes 4g ;).

Beautiful screen, decent OS, but the battery should have been better or the OS should have come optimized to provide better battery life.

Sure they had none in stock at the store, but the sales rep offered to me a new service in which they could ship me the product directly to my home.

My previous smartphones (from Palm and Samsung) promised things they simply did not deliver. The EVO does it all and it's fun to use. The down side is the woefully inadequate battery that ships with the phone. It borders on irresponsible (and maybe even falls into the category of \"false advertising\") for HTC to use such a ridiculously inadequate battery. If you get 3 hours of continuous use out of it, you're lucky. (Yes, I know all the reasons why the phone is a battery hog. They are irrelevant given that HTC was aware of the phone's power requirements and simply didn't address them in battery design.) Even with intermittent use, the battery barely makes it through the work day. You simply have to keep it plugged in ALL THE TIME with the option of using it off-charger if you absolutely must for short periods of time. Seidio sells an extended battery that will last through the day, but it is so big that you must use their humpback case with the battery. The thicker profile doesn't bother me as much as the fact that accessories (such as desk cradles or phones cases) as not compatible with the hump."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: Features, Performance, Ease of useCons: Battery lifeVery nice phone.

At first I saw a big (really big) screen and for a woman. I was like \"I'm not going to like this\" but I do like the price of my bill with some actual signal service. After playing with it all night, I love the phone. I practically sleep with it right next to me now. I got used to the screen after like 4 hrs of watching youtube videos and looking at forum sites. I don't ever want to go small again. Great on the eyes. Another thing I like about EVO, is the Android OS and market place. I kid you not. I've spent close to $250 on apps for the 3GS within the past year. The apps all on my EVO are FREE (So far 96 apps) and most apps they didn't have in the apple store or cost $. The soundboards are awesome! I find myself customizing my phone everyday. That's a good and a bad thing! But cool I have so many options to choose from. I hope I can post a link on here to see if you guys who are looking to buy the phone or any sprint phone can get a discount through work.

The Internet is extremely fast when compared to my old BB and the amount of operating memory insures that I don't get bogged down by trying to run too many things at once.

The screen is pretty large though which rocks because it's just like having a computer around you at all times.

In fact it's the best electronic device I have purchased in the last couple of years. Forget the iPhone, you will never be sorry for passing it over for the Evo. The Android OS has a great community developing the applications for it, it's growing like a weed and you only pay for the apps that you need additional features for. I have yet to BUY a single app, too many excellent free ones out there.The Evo's screen is huge and very responsive to even the lightest touch. Yet, it will not dial people from inside your pocket like older touch screen technology. The only down side that I have found with this phone is that you can't put it down! It's addictive.Great features like dual cameras - one in rear and one forward facing for video conferencing. Shoots fantastic HD video (for a phone) and the still look great too.

I come from WM 6.1 and have been a Windows Mobile user for a long time hoping that it would improve (sluggish, poor UI, not touch friendly, etc.). I wanted good integration/use with MS Office. Android has an app for MS Office. Battery life is fair with my level of use (I get 2 days per full charge). Have to charge nightly if I use heavy during day (internet, phone, GPS, BT, music). I'm planning on getting an extended battery and a car charger. The complaints that I have read are not that bad and doesn't bother me (fps capped @ 30, short batt life, no app manager, etc). Most, I hope, will be fixed with the upcoming FroYo update coming Aug 3rd. If not, there is usually an app or a group of people on the internet that have solutions and work arounds.I have forgotten about Windows. In just a few years, Android has improved on their OS, unlike WM. WM 7 is just around the corner, but its a little too little and a little too late. Sprint has come thru with this phone and their voice/data plans. However, a downside is the extra $10/phone even if you don't have 4G avail in your area. I travel to a city that has 4G so having the option to use it , when available, is a plus. Their plans are still the cheapest if you compare the same plan in other providers.

Having widgets at your disposal makes customizing it that much more fun. Having a huge app store for all your needs is super convenient. The huge screen is great for everything from texting, surfing, videos, and pictures. The 8mp camera takes awesome photos. It's just an overall great beast of a phone that has yet faced a contendor. If you're worried about the extra $10 a month, then this phone is not for you if that's a deciding factor. If you're going to complain about battery life, find a device that can do the same amount of things in a compact design and get better battery life and I'll switch to it.

Though the iPhone has more pixel density and 10fps more for video viewing, the Evo was so much easier of a device to view things on. Android is more customizable, HDMI out, way more of an open platform phone. The internet is better in some cases where Sprint is stronger, but not a fair competition.

That seems really funny to me, you have to get a third party app because the android programmers forgot to throw in an option to close the apps.

However, the screen is not so big to consider it too big for a mobile device, it's just perfect.I am very realistic when I compare devices, and I was actually hoping to like the iPhone more and find an excuse to buy it. But I am so glad I copared both phones side by side, and the Evo beats the cr@p out of the iPhone in every area. So sad I won't get an iPhone, but glad I got the better device.Now, from a developer's point of view, the Evo is just light years ahead of anything else out there. Only other Android devices can come close. But so far, none can touch it. If I was to say every advantage from a developer's point of view here, I would need my own blog in this site, just to make my point.Now (07/09/2010) there are software enhancements that any regular Joe can add to the Evo for free even though it still runs on the 2.1 Android, like Flash player. Out of the box, the Evo has Flaslite 4, but now, people can install the full blown Flash player v.10.1 and the Evo turns into an all"}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: price, cost of service, ease of use, superfast processor, impressive display, multitaskingCons: does NOT build you an island, turn itself into a jet and fly you there as advertised in a video I saw (look it up, lol)Very easy to use device. As with any new phone, it will take a little time to get used to navigating it, but the average user will be able to pick it up and use basic functions right away. I love the huge, vibrant display and even for it's large size, its slimness allows for it to comfortably sit in your pocket. The Android Market is finally a strong competitor to the iphone's App Store and far, far superior to the Palm App Catalog (I unfortunately got a Pre at launch last year). Considering the purchase price and Sprint subscription price (even with the required $10 upcharge), it is a great value compared to the iphone. Get one of these and you won't be sorry. Buy it at BestBuy and get your accessories there!

After seeing the EVO I knew that this was the phone that I needed.....the perfect blend of personal & business, all rolled up into one really spectacular package.I must admit I was incredibly hesitant after reading all of the reviews about the supposed poor battery life, but I will say that after having this phone for over 1 week now that I am glad I didn't listen to all the negativity.Working 10 hours a day and constantly being on my feet using apps, texting, using the phone for calls multiple hours in a day I will say that I am very very impressed with the battery life. The only thing that I can see that greatly zaps the battery life down to nothing is playing the incredible assortment of games on the phone....but even that takes over 2 hours to deplete the battery life.

It's my first Android phone (coming off Windows Mobile) and overall I like it better but it's going to take some getting used to. I'm kinda addicted to the Android Market. The screen size and resolution are great. The web browsing is far better than my old phone. Facebook and web based email are so easy to use. HTC's Sense gives you 7 home screens which is awesome.However, it doesn't always notify me when I get a text and yet sometimes will ding even when I didn't get a text...which is starting to bug my wife. Also, my wife isn't getting all the texts I send her (a problem that only started after I got the Evo). I miss my physical keyboard. The battery life is so-so...it USUALLY lasts me the whole day but not always.

I was a little hesitant only because of Sprint but am happy to say that I have had my EVO 4 for about week and I have NO REGRETS!!! I really love this phone.....it in my opinion has leaped the Iphone in features, benefits and overall performance. I'm not restricted to itunes and putting music, pics and other files is much more simple. it offers very accurate turn by turn GPS that I am using instead of my garmin and ofcourse Google voice works like a charm! I have not used the HDMI out yet but do plan on getting the cord. Battery life could be better but with a free app manager its simple to maintain.

Also very nice camera with a strong flash. The camcorder can also take some great video in well lit areas. Video conferencing via the front facing camera using the Fring app worked seamlessly. Large display makes it very pleasant to view various web pages, and apps. Also the large display helps make the keys on the virtual keyboard very accessible, and easy to use. Overall a great, snappy device, with great potential. I wish the calendar was more like the Pre. I also wish all the chats were in one thread like the Pre, versus opening up different apps.

Left Verizon for Sprint based on the cost comparison with friends. Pros: The EVO is fun--will never get bored learning all of the things it does. Handles calendars and contacts very well. Web experience is great. Front-facing camera is useful and fun! GPS is pretty good. Cons: I do get a few more dropped calls with Sprint than I did with Verizon. And Sprint is evasive on when 4G will come to my area, so I'm not getting the full benefit of the extra $10/month I am paying. Battery life is, by far, the largest con. Battery barely lasts a day--even with the advanced task killer. If anything, this could be the deal breaker. GPS wouldn't accept an exact address--I had to choose from a (short) list of addresses that were close to my destination. Charging cord quality is questionable--I had to take my USB charging cord back as exterior the coating came apart from the connector and wires were exposed. Picture quality on the 8mp camera is pretty good, though some colors are not accurate (ex: purple looks blue). Reading a pdf file on the phone was not good at all. Will try again.

The EVO's bigger screen makes using the touchscreen much easier, but my ultimate solution is using the Swype keyboard, this thing is the future of touchscreen data input.As for Android, I'm really enjoying the level of customization the OS gives you, plus the ability to have live widgets on the home screens (something you can't get on most other phone operating systems).Oh, and the phone has 4G :) I live in downtown Chicago and the service on 4G can be a little spotty, but when it works it is lightning fast.

I've had the phone a month now and I feel comfortable with it. The issue with battery life is three-fold: 1) screen brightness, 2) 4G, and 3) Android OS. The screens too bright as is (unless your in the sun), so turn down the brightness. Access to 4G consumes a lot of power. I don't have access to 4G where I live, so the constant searching for 4G drains the battery, but there's any easy fix - turn it off (unless your in a 4G area and need to use it). Android does not provide a mechanism to manage memory (aka kill running apps when not in use). Again, the fix is to easy - install a task killer, but you have to set it to ignore the essential apps so functionality isn't hindered (i.e. alarms still work, sync happens, etc). Keep in mind, apps start on their own - you don't need to do anything - it just happens (that's Android).I am happy with the phone. I can easily get 24 hours with moderate to heavy use, 48 hours with light use, and 4 days with syncs set to manual. Battery life isn't perfect, but no where near as bad as everyone says that it is.

This is a problem with all Android phones not just the Evo- there is a an app for $4 that will work - seems like a terrible oversight on Google's part.My wife has the same phone and has much of the same issues. Both our daughters have Palm Pres and after watching us, have decided to keep them and not upgrade."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: everythingThe phone is the best ever. The battery is even better after the lastest software upgrade. I wish they had this phone out earlier. Finally a competition for the Iphone but only better."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: vibrant screen call quality featuresCons: battery lifeThis phone is the bomb. Keep an extra battery on hand and you will love it. Did I mention you can replace the battery?????"}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: Great price,fast ,easy to use,great cameraCons: Sprint needs to come up with a better carrying caseMoved up to try this phone. I have now had it for a month and can say I have never been happier with a product. Has never dropped a call. Fast ...OMG...apps are easy to download and use. As for battery life as long as use close out the apps you are using it will last all day. I myself use app killer and that closes everything at one time ."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: Everything!!Cons: Bad Battery LifeThis phone is the best phone I have ever had. I have had this phone for two days and I just cant put it down. The only problem that I have is the battery life. The battery dies very quickly if you are constantly on it. But other than that, I say its the number one phone and a must have."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: Man, Everything.Cons: Was battery performance - but since update, it's kickin' chicken!Absolutely zero issues with the phone. Sprint had a hick-up with the most recent HTC Software update, but that's been ironed out.Since then, battery life is GREATLY enhanced.All those reviews complaining about battery performance should go back and check the battery out since the most recent update.The phone is fast, responsive, tons of apps (how many do you really need, anyway? Everyone has the same 20 apps - on Android or iPhone)."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: Features!Cons: BatteryI absolutely love this phone -- it's one of the most amazing and exciting electronic gadgets I've ever owned.Here are some of my favorite features:* Voice to Text -- it's incredible how well this recognizes speech! From the Google search bar on the home screen, you can not only do verbal internet searches, you can call people from your contacts and choose navigation points, by saying \"call ...\" or \"navigate to ...\" You can even use it to dictate text messages -- a great feature if you're driving.* The Screen -- it's huge, and bright, and gorgeous"}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: Sprint Speed. Video chat. Easy to use. CLEAR CALLS. FAST- FAST- FAST internet.Cons: short battery life (too short), doesn't really SYNC with Mac's- not easily anyways.I'll start off with GET IT AT BEST BUY- the backing of a company that will honor their extended warranty is amazing!! Plus don't have to wait for your rebate in the mail- and there's always someone there to help you! Get it at BEST BUY ONLY please!! it's worth it.Ok so as my title stated I have tried the iPhone (all generations), all BlackBerrys as well. I'll start off with the good. This phone was made to be used. What I mean is that it's a user friendly phone, customize it the way you want. The iPhone lacks that feature, the only way you can fully customize it is JAIL BREAK and the VOIDS Apples service. You can sort your texts, send emails, view videos etc.iPhone VS HTC. Apple is Apple- there's no fighting it. Apple is an AMAZING company and I personally am a die hard Apple fan- however- on the iPhone it lacks very basic stuff, for example, the other day I entered a site, viewed a PDF, SAVED it to my phone and while I was on the phone later that day I needed to see that PDF doc, simple, I pulled up the PDF while I was on the phone- boom! iPhone doesn't allow you to store anything like that.Another great feature is that you can ALREADY video chat- don't have to wait until your friends get an iPhone, i have done it already- even while i was driving... pretty sweet!The Battery life SUCKS!! Wow it's so bad."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: EverythingCons: Sprint NetworkThis is by far the best phone I've ever had. Super fast, easy to use and there are tons of cools apps. It's got it all and then some. Battery will burn quick if you've not careful, but it's manageable once you learn the tricks of the trade.The only negative is Sprint's 4G network. Rarely works and to make matters worse, it blocks the network connection while scanning for 4G. You have to keep it turned off unless you're stationary (and lucky enough to get a 4G connection)."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: Super Fast & Great PicsCons: Converting Blackberry to Android phones and data conflicts with Facebook if done in the wrong order.I waited for months for Sprint to release the EVO. My Best Buy group in Rogers, Arkansas took very good care to setup my phone, provide accessories and even transfer my numbers (I was in too big of a hurry the night of pickup). This phone EXCEEDS my expectations. The only drawback is the power. This can be worked around by managing the settings. i.e. Living in a 3g area the 4g can be turned off thus saving power. Sprint TV is still quirky but great quality picture. The EVO is super fast with high quality video and pictures.One perk....My IPhone friends want to play with my phone and love watching video or the world cup on live tv. The kickstand is icing on the cake for watching videos.The coolest thing is being able to open those online ads from retailers web pages. I can actually see sale circulars, read docs and view presentations without buying additional software or complicated steps. It is like a mini PC, Phone, Video Camera, Digital Camera and lastly a phone to call people.I definitely don't miss my Blackberry 8330. Now instead of Blackberry thumb. I have 10 finger capability."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: all of the apps and camera clarityCons: doesnt have a sqitch to turn on vibrate.... nor can u flip between apps and return with out searching.I love this phone it does everything and then things u couldn't possibly imagine a phone doing. I have been a palm user for atleast 8 years. This switch makes me wish I switched a lot sooner. It's a definite brag buy... and a great conversation piece. Get it even if u just want to ONLY call ppl. You will find other uses. I promise."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: Ease of use, great sound quality, awesome picturesCons: NAJust like everyone else said, this phone rocks!! The battery life can suck if you don't know anything about an android phone. The best app for killing apps after you are done is the \"Toggle Settings\". You can have everything put on auto kill so that it shuts done when you are done with it. You have to open each app to put then on the auto kill list. I always check toggles I and toggles II in the app to make sure they are definitely closed. Now that most of my apps are on auto kill my phone will last all day and them some. 5+ stars *****"}]

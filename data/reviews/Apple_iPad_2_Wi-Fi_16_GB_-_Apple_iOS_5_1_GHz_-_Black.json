[{"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: Battery Life, overall speed and performance, portability, ease of useCons: Wifi sometimes stays \"asleep\" after sleep, Some pay apps you must buy twice between iPad and iPod/iPhoneI purchased the iPad 2 to be used as a work/home mixed use device. I waited for the second generation knowing Apple goes on a (usually) yearly refresh cycle. I did get to use the first iPad thanks to friends who had one, and am glad I waited.I have a 32 gig white wifi. I thought the white finish might be distracting for video at first but even in bright light I have no problems. Wifi signal holds well in all areas of my work/home but I find sometimes I must turn wifi on and off if device has been sleeping to \"wake\" the connection.As an e-reader I think it works well with the screen brightness very low. While not as easy on the eyes as my wife's Nook, I still don't feel the eye fatigue I thought I would from the screen with brightness down low. It does work with Nashville's library system, but only for ePub books via Overdrive app.The screen looks great and battery life thus far has been excellent. Form factor of the thinner edges and lighter weight is noticeable and makes the device easier to handle.The ability to toggle the switch on the side from a mute to an orientation lock is fantastic and a wonderful idea. If you hold the down volume longer than a second, it goes straight to mute.

They're best suited for video, under good lighting. I use the iPad everyday for email, weather reports, news, and games.

Does make it heavier but removes all worries of scratching the screen and damage to the ipad. The battery life is unreal. Eight hours of use and still had 30 percent battery life. Using the maps/navigation app to plan our summer vacation trip was a snap. Much quicker than using computer. And linking it up to our wireless HP printer thru our Verizon wireless wi-fi was a breeze.

I downloaded an application that lets me listen to my Sirius programs on the iPad. Many other applications and games are available and cheaper than downloads for PCs. I also use it to access my email and Facebook. In our travels, I rarely had to use my husbands laptop. My only complaint is that I cannot play my FB games on it as it will not download Shockwave or Java applications due to Apple issues.

The small size and portability were definitely nice features.Features that should be free, like printing, cost a fee to buy the print application. I might have used it like a laptop to write and send emails, but there should be more functionality built in for it to be able to fill that role.

I guess I though it would be faster with a dual core and the HTC running on Gingerbread. It is more than I wanted to spend, but by far is the best quality and bang for the buck.

Everyone that we showed them to could not believe the quality and all of them said \"you took the pictures with that\".

Anything you imagine is there, Yeah this product is expensive because it has 64 GB but that's worth it. You need the most storage you can get with an apple product like the ipad. There is no possible way you can get more storage on this product unless you buy the 64 GB version. This is one of the biggest problems with apple products. This is the only way they get more money from their buyers. Smart right? maybe not to you but to them it is. Okay so back to the ipad2. Yes there are free apps and costing apps. You will be buying apps so be sure you have money for that. If you're budget isn't that big than buy a less GB ipad so you have money to buy the apps. This isn't the smallest tablet out there making it a little harder to carry and play with. so make sure you are okay with the size of the ipad. If you're hands are small there is the galaxy tab but I feel like it has no chance to compare close with the ipad.

The iPad easily meets my expectations for both performance and quality. The user experience is smooth and polished, apps availability is great, and battery life appears to be as good as advertised. I've never been an Apple fan, but after using it for a few weeks have to conclude that they hit the target dead-center with the iPad. I can finally travel without having to lug around a laptop and all its associated paraphernalia.Outside of the known issues (limited PC connectivity, very limited printer support, lack of Flash support) I've only noted two other negatives, and they're pretty minor given how I use the device day-by-day. First, when transferring photos I have to directly connect my cameras to the camera connection kit vice being able to use either of my USB card readers. Second, initially the iPad would not charge when connected to my PCs' USB ports because a PC's unmodified USB power output is too low to trigger the iPad's charge cycle.

A business-minded consumer or a more tech savvy one will notice more of the iPad's flaws like a lack of Flash support (which doesn't really matter since Adobe is abandoning Flash for mobile devices anyways), a very limited selection of supported file types (this affects which files, movies, etc.., you can just import to the tablet without any extra steps or conversions), and the simple fact that trying to use any tablet to type up and create papers/articles/PowerPoints is more work than using a laptop or desktop. I do not consider the lack of USB or other ports a flaw of the iPad due to the fact that the extremely slim design that people love about the iPad would be sacrificed and with Bluetooth and the many wireless portable hard drives available, size capacity is not limited to just 16/32/64 Gigabytes if you really needed more and wireless file transfer is continuing to evolve and get easier.In summation, the iPad 2 is an excellent choice in the tablet market but it is certainly not perfect so if the few flaws the iPad 2 have impacts the planned use of it, choose a different Android tablet that may satisfy your"}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: Easy to use, excellent battery, funCons: n/aHad a Motorola Xoom and did not like it at all.

Watched a movie on NetFlix, again very easy and great quality on the screen. I have a stylus and that can be useful but not required. We purchased a keyboard but I would recommend you try using the IPad without one first. If you feel you need it, then get one.One negative. The cameras are of very poor quality.

The build quality of the Honeycomb tablets weren't as high quality as the iPad2. There are just so many more options in terms of accessories and apps available to purchase. The cameras are lacking and low res but this wasn't the reason why I bought a tablet. I also was worried that most sites would default to lame iPhone versions of their website but now that everyone has an iPad you get the full web experience (well without flash), or something optimized for the iPad. Lack of flash isn't a big deal because most sites have videos that will open directly from their site without having to go into the YouTube app. Battery life is top notch.

The tight integration with iTunes and the Apple App Store, the slick interface (even my 3 year old can find his favorite apps), and the overall massive selection of add on applications make the iPad the best overall tablet out there.The design of the tablet is simple, and it's amazingly thin. The only Apple devices that are thinner are the iPods. I have an iPod touch 4th Generation, and while it is much more portable and has a much higher pixel density screen, the the battery life is horrible when actually using the wifi or watching movies or playing games. The iPad just keeps going - it is truly amazing. 10+ hours on a single charge while still providing a good end user experience.The only minor gripe is the pixel density on the screen. 1024x768 is a little on the low side and you can pick out the pixels fairly easily from a moderate distance.

Lack of flash like everyone says is extremely annoying. Splashtop is an app that allows you to remote to your home pc thus giving you flash on your iPad.

PDFs are then found under the PDF library in iBooks. 2) Email: While typing emails is a bit cumbersome on the virtual keyboard, reading emails is great and much more convenient than a computer. You can set up all of your webmail accounts and even outlook accounts from work (though this may require special security measures in some instances...just a password lock on the iPad in my case).

I was able to wait a year and purchase the second version of the iPad.If you are looking for something to surf the net, check emails, show off pictures, and consume media, then look no further. It was not made to compete with a full size laptop, or replace a computer. It was made to consume media. Email, music, movies, pictures,Internet. 95% of the time, I just want to surf the net. I don't want to grab a laptop, wait for it to boot up, then search for what i want. The ipad is always on, so there is no waiting. Its light, and fast. This thing does all of them better than anything else. Sure there are some tablets with better specs, but none can compete with the iPads ease of use. The simplicity, super long lasting battery life, and tens of thousands of apps make it the best.I highly recommend this product.."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: faster, thinner, lighter,Battery lifeCons: CamerasThis is much better than the first Ipad overall its faster, thinner, lighter, and it comes with cameras...The cameras are kinda bad but its better than nothing.

I immediately purchased the WIFi 64gb, white version and was extactic being an Ipad 1 owner of the new improvements. Upon powering on the device I immediately noticed backlight bleeding through the \"connect to Itunes\" black screen. While not a big deal for some, this bothered me considering the price tag. Also, the main reason for the upgrade was to be able to use this device with facetime and skype. I expected the cameras to be average, but was not anticipating this. As a past owner of the Motorola Xoom, Galaxy tab, Droid x, Droid Incredible, Samsung Omnia, and many other devices, I noticed that the camera quality on both cameras was the absolutely worse I had seen. I have seen flip phones with better quality. Also, the 720p video is only if all the conditions are perfect because I am getting lousy performance in a naturally lit room. Overall, the Ipad 2 seems fast, but not noticeably faster than the Ipad 1. I was expecting more from the dual processing power and double RAM.

My issue with e readers is the proprietary content. If I want to re read one of my books, I get it off the shelf. If Amazon or B&N goes outta business and they no longer support their device, then what do I do? The iPad let me download both the nook and the kindle apps, and therefore I wasn't tied to one store.

Many more websites use flash than fans like to admit. You wont notice the lack of flash on the iphone, android, or computer because all those devices support flash. The lack of support by apple is maddening. Also, you can NOT access the file system at all, and the default player will only play apple native formats.

Apple products cost more, but they work and do everything you could want to do. I looked at every tablet from $200-$600 and found nothing to come close to the iPad. The Kindle Fire, Nook Tablet, and BlackBerry Playbook have VERY LIMITED marketplaces since they don't run full Android marketplace. Apple is the only company that isn't blowing out their tablets after disappointing sales because they are the only one building a time-tested operating system and platform. Asus, Lenovo, HP, Acer, Blackberry, and Vizio have all reduced their tablet prices by up to 80% off because they are selling inferior products for the same price as the iPad when they are originally released. Would you rather have paid $600 for an iPad or HP Touchpad? If you bought the HP six months ago you would have paid that price and been left with an expensive paperweight - same thing with the BlackBerry playbook.There is such a great selection of accessories to make the iPad unique to yourself as well.

The resolution of the tablet itself is great.

Android may have 200 if there lucky. If you don't care about apps then get a droid, I don't android will 300 by the end of the year. Apple makes it so easy to do anything, I can run flash on my iPad if I want, what is the big deal with flash? It's buggy and uses more power. HTML 5 is the future. Everything is simple to use and apps are easy to install, no viruses with apple either. Android has a few viruses in the wild now, why do you need a virus detector for your phone or tablet?

The dual processor is very fast, they claim 9 times faster. I wanna say four times faster which is still impressive. It still gets 10 hours of battery life which is probably one thing alone that amazes me with a dualprocessor.yes it's thinner and lighter but I had no complaints about the first generation size or weight.

If you are going back and forth between this size HD and the others, consider this; although it says 64GB, when you look in the settings under capacity it says 59.1GB. That means the operating system is using nearly 5 gigs right off the bat.

The buyer needs, however, to be aware of a few things when they make the purchase. First make sure that if you want to print from the ipad that you have a printer that will connect with it. Not all printers on the market will work. Second, purchase a stand so that you can easily prop it up on your desk. Third, buy a stylus since large fingers can easily leave prints on the screen or hit the wrong spot. There are covers that double as a stand, but I found the one I bought was not very stable. A separate stand is better. Also be aware that there is no built-in word processor and to type documents you will probably have to buy the Pages App. It comes equipped with the Safari browser and you will have to be content with that since there is no version of Firefox or other browsers that will work on the ipad.

The other tablets look ugly, clunky, slow, unsophisticated, etc., etc., when compared side-by-side with the iPad. I must say that this is the first Apple device I have owned in over 30 years, and I must also say that it's difficult to match what is basically an amazing EXPERIENCE (yes, you are not just buying a device when you buy an iPad, you are buying a very rewarding experience!) It's a true pleasure, from the moment you open the box, throughout the configuration process, and finally on the everyday use of this absolutely wonderful merger of technology and art. Additionally, I just purchased an Android phone for me, and a Windows Phone for my wife, and only the Windows Phone experience can be remotely compared to the iOS experience.

Don't try to save a buck by going with Zoom or other cheaper alternative. There is a reason the Zoom sold around 400k tables to Apple's 9.25 MILLION last quarter - the iPad 2 is a superior product from top to bottom. Apple could have sold a lot more than 9.25 Million but they could not even keep up with the demand.

The iPad really just feels awesome to hold in the hand and it so well balanced that holding it for a while is no problem at all....Now what is new about the iPad well it has the addition of two cameras that well suck to say the least and doesn't take good photos and okay videos, but gets the job done when it comes to FaceTime. It also has the new A5 chip which does feel faster than the old A4 chip and makes app switching and loading much faster and handles multi-tasking better with out any lag or crashes. Comes in two colors now (white or black) and is offered on verizon's or AT&T's 3G service.What it all comes down to is if you do have the first gen iPad then there's no reason to really upgrade because you can do everything that the iPad 2 has, now if your new to the iPad or an apple fan boy then jump on this device assuming that you can get your hands on one, I'm lucky to have mine!!!"}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: Thinner, Lighter, Faster.Cons: Prayer goes out to the People of Japan.I had the first generation iPad, and bought the iPad 2.

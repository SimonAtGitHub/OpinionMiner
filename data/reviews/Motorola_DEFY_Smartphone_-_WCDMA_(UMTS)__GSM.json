This phone works very well in my area and the sound quality is awesome and very loud. To me, the best part is the plan I switched to with unlimited everything. T-mobile definitely is more bang for the buck especially with unlimited text and data plans. Verizon had unlimited text and web but now charges a la cart now and for me that sucks. The battery life is the only thing I can complain about, I will be looking into an extended life battery."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: Water and scratch resistent.Cons: Internet connection.The phone seems to be ideal for the active teenager. Only issues we have seen so far is it seems to have trouble connecting to internet at times, even when there is tower and at other times no tower when other Tmobile cell phones in same location have tower.

I wanted to return it the next day. The signal strength is always weak no matter what. I try and download different apps and there was always a problem. So I walked around with a brand new phone that had issues from the start. The battery got warm until I let it run down completely before recharging it..after listening to the FM radio that is installed for 4 hours or more the switch over when a call came in did not work....so a complete shut down and restart was required.

[{"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "This is asuch a great purchase and the price is fantastic. It is really stylish and has the look of a much more expensive smart phone. The keyboard is just large enough to use with ease, however large fingers might have slight touble.The screen is bright and colourful and shows fairly well in sunlight. The Camera quality isn't great however it has a range of effects to utilise. The video recording is useless on the Nokia C3. It will only take 5 seconds of video and the quality isn't great anyway.The phone comes with some really great features though, these include a range of games (a number of which are trails however) as well as a radio, mp3 player and very easy access to Facebook and Twitter through the 'communities' app and to your emails. The operating system is the same as a number of other Nokias and is very easy to navigate.The biggest problem with the Nokia C3 is the signal. Incorperated into the phone is wifi however there is no 3G and this makes internet access very difficult if you are in an area with no wifi. This is obviously a major floor with the phone and part of the reason that Nokia has got the price down, however if you can get past this then you have a truely fantastic phone."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Now thats what I like .....Not too complicated! and a key board layout you can actually understand / use.Modern, sleek design, and a bright display( a variable font size as well , so no need for specs)Only slight issue.... connection for charger seems a little flimsy , I thought it was on charge but jack plug had got disconnected :-(Overall very good value"}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "PROS : nice qwerty keypad that makes it easy to type in a text. battery life could last for 2-3 days with heavy-usage. customizable themes and home display screen CONS : phone connects to the mobile network (EDGE/GPRS) by itself. so if you are on a plan, you may be charged for it. I removed wap and gprs settings on my phone to stop the phone by connecting it to the network. fonts are too large (hope they release a new software for this). characters on text messages displays wrong letter (master reset on the phone fixed this issue). so far, there are workarounds for some of the issues on the phone.. the only unresolved problem im having with it is the font size. if you guys are heavy texters and loves to do instant messaging, this is the right phone for you"}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: This is S40. That being said, the Nokia C3 has nice apps for messaging and e-mail (Google, Yahoo, MS Live/Hotmail and Ovi). It comes with a few games (Block'd, Bounce Tales, Diamond Rush, Sudoku). Opera mobile 4.2 is pre-installed and works wonderful. Speaking of the browsers, I don't really know why people complain about the Nokia browser that much.I bought that phone primarily as a back up phone for my Nokia N900. Keen eyes would surely see that both phones are using the same battery (BJ-5L).Wi-Fi works ok. The range at which you can pick-up signals is short. My router is in the living room and I was in my bed this morning and could barely see it (around 8 to 12m through 2 walls).The Nokia C3 can easily be configured to use Fido Internet (call them for the settings). I have just tried it and bought a one day pass which allowed me to play youtube video, although the quality is only ok. Gtalk works too !The screen is of good quality. Viewing angle is not badCons: Google maps applications require a touch screen so I was not able to use that.

Easy to use phone, bluetooth works well, wifi connects in seconds if you know your passcode (rediscovered mine on underside of router). Havnt downloaded any themes yet, the ones supplied were not impressive. Pleased with music player and radio through speakers, though headphones just adequate. Camera alright. Having fun with voice recorder, handy for recording guitar and silly txt alerts, lol :D Took a few minutes to get the supplied 2GB memory card out on the side and replace with a bigger capacity one (you have to press it and it pops out).

I leave the phone on all the time and I have only charged it once in two weeks. The ring is loud enough for me to hear it through its leather case, in my handbag in another room. The qwerty keyboard means that I am now happy to send texts, something I previously hated. Being able to download games and apps is a bonus so I can use it to pass time when waiting for the kids to finish a club or other activity. It feels solid and looks good (the hot pink is hard to lose but actually is quite a dark colour so doesn't look too girly). I was pleased to find a phone with such good features but without 3G as it didn't want to pay lots on PAYG for it to connect to things that I don't use.

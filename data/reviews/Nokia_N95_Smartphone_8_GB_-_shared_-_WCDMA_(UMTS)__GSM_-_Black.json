I had a list of things I wanted in a phone and I have to say, this phone not only had everything I've ever needed, but I was surprised on things I didn't know about! For instance, I didn't even know it had an accelerometer when I bought it! But for now I'll just list the major features and review them:CAMERA(s): The main 5MP camera takes great pictures. Obviously it's not the same quality as a stand alone, say Sony Cybershot of equal quality. But the different scene shots and bright flash make up for that. (portrait, night shots, fast-moving, etc) Video is as good if not better than a Sony Cybershot point and shoot camera. (You can even edit pictures right on your phone!)CALL QUALITY/SPEAKERPHONE: Call quality has been very good. Speakerphone is VERY loud thanks to the pair of high quality speakers.GPS: The assisted GPS antenna on the device is pretty good. When using Nokia Maps to navigate, it takes very little time to connect (5-10 secs mostly) You have to keep the slider open however to get good signal. If you don't like nokia maps, you can always buy/download other software like Google maps, TomTom, etc. Very handy."}, {"rating": "2", "user": "-", "raw-text": "So after almost a year and a half of hearing about this phone, and it finally coming in US form, and a sweet deal I couldn't pass up, I had to replace my N75 with this. Best decision I have ever made. I think it's funny how since it's release, I haven't seen one phone from a US carrier that comes close to what this offers. Highlights: -Great 2.6\" display. -S60. -WiFi. -GPS (a little slow getting started but works well and there's even a cool \"GPS data\" application to track speed, mileage, time). -Built in Nokia Maps. -HSDPA is pretty fast (900-1380 kb/s). -S60 browser is superb and yes there's flash support here (Flash Lite). -Reception is tops. -Stereo speakers are very loud and sound great. -Music player is very good but only using aftermarket headphones. Nokia's suck. -5 MP camera is excellent. -VGA video recording is excellent. -Battery is good enough to last me a full day with web surfing, checking email, watching videos, listening to music, texting, making phone calls, updating my calendar, and using Google maps. -Nokia's firmware updates. Disappointments: -Made in Korea (I expect to see Finland under the battery). -Build quality can be better. The phone creaks almost all the time when grabbed where the microSD hatch is (weakest part of phone). -Front facing camera can be bothersome since it sticks out off the face of the phone 1mm. -Find myself hitting the end key, instead of the clear button sometimes. -The lip below the bottom row of number keys is annoying for me a lot of"}, {"rating": "2", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: Easy accessible programs.

Cons: Learning Curve Nokia hits a home run with this very competent phone and dual 5 MP camera! Maybe not as good as a stand-alone digital camera, but, for snapshots (optical zoom is a weakness), this comes very close and makes carrying one device extremely handy. Camera even has video capability at 30fps! Nokia should have put the Xenon flash on this device like the N82 or N78, but, it works out fine for daytime shots. If you're relying on this camera for night shots, you're expecting too much! This is for the North American N95-3 edition. This phone is manufactured in Finland. I previously had a Nokia 6682 for three years and the phone still works fine... handed it to a family member! This new and updated Symbian firmware set brings this phone experience to whole new level! In case you did not know, Symbian , unlike other mobile OS platforms is a very mature extremely stable (read rock solid), memory efficient operating platform. This phone is on the Series 60, 3rd edition. It is the most populated phone platform worldwide outside of North America. The Symbian OS while intuitive may take some time getting used to.

I reviewed the i-phone but I'm not sold on their concept, so moving forward. I will keep this in a detailed pros/cons scenario. PROS Camera: With a 5 Megapixel Carl Zeiss, other than some Sony Ericsson's, nothing comes close. Seriously, I don't use optical zoom, so I no longer need my stand-alone digital camera. Could use a stronger flash though. I'd give up some battery life for a stronger flash. :-) Video: The fact that I can watch it on TV without it being pix elated is sheer delightful! By far the best video/phone I've had yet. Symbian: I have used Palm, Windows and Linux. While I like Linux, Symbian by far is the most user friendly OS. Very robust and personally think it has more running for it than any other platform in the market. Also, you'll love the Video Center where you can watch news, YouTube and even do Podcasting. Screen: Colors are brilliant and well lit. Web Browser: Better than ANY browser on the market. That's a promise. GPS: A little slow (1 or 2 minutes) to grasp connection but once it has it, you're hooked. Wi-Fi: Every smartphone should have wi-fi if you ask me and not your carrier. :-) The Gizmo project application's nice, too! CONS None for me although I would have wished for, oh, a bigger battery. :-) I think battery life's is good but not exceptional. The bottom line is this is NOT a phone.

The call clarity is crystal clear. I think the sliding camera mechanism on the back is cool too. I love the dual slider however the buttons for the multimedia functions are difficult to use and press. I was pleasantly surprised that phone could actually accept a 4gb mirco SD card which allowed to pretty much load up my phone with mp3 files. The sound quality for the music is superb! However I would have liked it I could get more bass with playback. The ergonomics is of the device can be tricky at first but you can easily overcome that. Despite the fact that I could not get 3G service in North America with this device, I was still pleased with it's EDGE speeds and capabilities. Overall, I am very impressed with the overall performance of the N95-1 and, I really look forward to getting my N95-4 8GB.

Uses all 8Gb's as ram so it is almost impossible for the phone to freeze. Fast interface that supports even web 2.0 apps. The GPS is a great add on and the new Nokia maps interface is amazing. It also has the amazing sound quality that Nokia is known for! (One thing you need to remember is that you have to make adjustments on the phone configerations cause the phone is not made for the US market).Cons: Sometimes depending on your provider your might have sound quality problems! Also it doesn't support office applications as well as I would expected to do. Price a little high but worth every pennie.If you want to get a quality phone, that is the best I've tried in a while.

Herewith my review on both Nokias: Nokia N95's plusses: - Excellent 5 Mp Carl Zeiss Optics Tessar Auto focus camera. - Built in Internal GPS. Though USD 42 Holux GPSlim 236 GPS receiver is more superior (http://www.phonearena.com/htmls/Nokia-N95-Review-review-r_1744-p_7.html) - Stereo sound, wifi connection, infra red. - For my age, bigger display with same resolution does really help. - Feel more robust and sturdy. Nokia 6120 Plusses: - Built in display rotation. - Built in panoramic shot. - Small, lightweight and economical. - Candy bar form factor will last longer as no moving parts. - Better battery life. I charged the phone battery once every 4 \u0096 5 days. Both phones work well with 8GB Micro SD Card. The other features are about the same, as both are Symbian S60 3rd so my programs collections for Nokia 6120 Classic are also work with Nokia N95. N95 has 4 times bigger internal memory (\u0105 40 Mb vs \u0105 160 Mb) but with 6120's 40 Mb I had not yet faced any problem. So if I have to buy a new phone from my own money and for my own use, I will still go for Nokia 6120 Classic (or Nokia N82 now). With additional USD 42 Holux GPSlim 236 Bluetooth GPS receiver it will also guides me as N95 does even with better satellites connections.

Nokia will also be intruducing an 8GB version of the N95 under the assumed Music version. Some applications may be missing on that line due to the extra memory.

Even when the volume is turned all the way up, it is sometimes difficult to hear who you are talking to on the other end, and that can be annoying. Sometimes I am forced to turn the speakerphone on when I would prefer to use the handset just in order to hear the person clearly. The downloadable applications are very impressive, alot of options as far as those are concerned. The camera takes great pics. The battery does get used up fast when you are using the applications.

Nice but not worth upgrading for. Phone is black..Ho Hum I don't view phones as fashion statements so this means nothing to me. The glass is more flush with the case though not allowing the grit to get in the seams. Again,,no big deal. The GUI carousel is different. I like both equally well, Now for the reason the N95-4 is better,,, SPEE D.....The OS is much faster. The camera opens immediately rather then the 8 seconds on the N95-3 (pre FW) The OS is faster in many cases. That's the only reason I am keeping it and since the wife does not want the N95-3 (happy 6126 owner) I will most likely sell it. I highly recommend the N95-4.

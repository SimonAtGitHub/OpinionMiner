First impressions are the size (plenty of room for entire hand) and heft (solid build, nice rubber grip surfaces). Nice balance now to my larger lens. Batteries are big and expensive & charger is big. LCD is fantastic, and the viewfinder is big. Shutter release is like a hair-trigger and the camera operates with a sense of urgency - very little lag or mirror transition delay. Even sounds much more pro than the Rebels. Great image quality, in my opinion. 8 FPS sounds like a machine gun (in a good way). Highly customizable, with three custom modes in lieu of the Basic Zone modes, my menu, and even more custom functions. Custom modes are nice for panic shots where you're transitioning from one type of subject to another and have no time to dial in the settings. 19 AF points and multiple modes for AF are great. Full HD video was a bonus - cool to use with SLR lenses - although I'm still figuring out how to maintain consistant focus in that mode. After downloading, playback is a bit jerky, but that might be the computer or software I'm using. Control layout is good, but I'm still getting used to locations and functions.

You do have to set the camera properly: custom functions III 1 through 3 and the AF area selection mode need to be set properly for the shooting situation in order to get the best results. One downside for me is that I can get no visual confirmation of achieved focus when I am in Servo mode: with the 40D I did get a short red flash on the focus point even in Servo mode, while on the 7D I only get it on One-Shot mode, and then all focus points blink red and also the area between the focus points gets a red shade. The new Polymer Network LCD focusing screen sure needs some improvements. ISO performance: there sure is a big improvement from the 40D, as expected, however the noise at high ISO (1600 to 3200 is what I tried so far) has a very irregular pattern, with some very hard speckles that are hard to reduce with commercial software. On the other side you have so much resolution available that you almost never need 100% crops, and you can reduce noise by downsizing the end result.

Under most circumstances I regarded 8MP as more than enough to print a full page pin sharp, even with a bit of cropping. Especially when you consider that the combination of an 8MP sensor with a good quality prime lens can outperform a camera with a sensor twice the size with a consumer zoom lens. Hence, I would rather spend the money on good quality glass than a camera with more megapixels. I also abhorred that fact that large sensors produce large files that slow down your computer and clog up your hard disks. So, after all these grumblings, why did I give in? Simple, 8fps and auto focus. There is a lot more to a camera than sensor size. In the end it is just a number which consumers can grapple with, and marketers love to exploit. When the camera arrived, I picked it up, and automatically I got the feel that I had upgraded from driving a little hatchback, to driving a luxury German sedan.

Contrast that to maybe 25% in focus action shots when using the 40D. I love the orientation-linked focus points or areas. I no longer need to change points when shooting vertical vs horizontal - it's automatic after choosing it once. Nice! The noise performance is very good.

The negatives of the 40D are lack of weather sealing, 6.5 frames per second (fps) repeat rate, 1600 ISO max (can be pushed higher) and some focusing issues especially in sports photography. Of course, when comparing with the the DReb series, these \"negatives\" immediately become positives. The 40D has better construction, much faster repeat rate, and much better focussing (the T1i has, arguably better high ISO capabilities). The 40D compares well with the Nikon D90.

I have started to do more people pictures at weddings and portraits and the external flash operation of the 7D is extremely simple and reliable. I was using a Taiwan wireless flash trigger and not only did it add cost over the 50D I was using at the time it was very unreliable. Now I can mix my internal flash, 430EX and 550EX very flexibly and have it work every time. This alone was worth the upgrade cost. I have a number of significant family events and trips coming up and was considering a separate HD movie camera. I came to the conclusion I'd be better off with just one device that did both. The 7D did not disappoint. The images are very clear and HD movie mode operation is a snap. Plus I have all my lens to choose from which was definitely a extra benefit over a separate HD movie camera. My only dilemma now is do I keep the 50D as backup?

Buy the best UV filter you can, and put it on the front of every lens immediately. Never take it off. Buy the extended warranty for lenses and the camera body. In my opinion the best deal is to buy the body separately (no kit lens) and then buy a lens that is best suited to your typical shooting needs. Then go to a park and spend about 6 hours just learning the camera. Take your time. Explore. Don't assume your vast experience with digital SLRs or videocams is going to give you instant wisdom and ability with the 7D. Let the camera grow into your hands until it's an extension of you.

I also enjoy the picture style function; it allows you to essentially color correct in camera. You can create almost any tone with it and it works in the video mode too. The variable frame rates are very useful. It also, does wonderful in low light. The only problem on might encounter is rolling shutter. During video mode, if one were to swish pan, the subjects in view get skewed and the problem is not terrible, but it is certainly present. Also, the 60p frame rate only shoots in 1280 by 720, not full HD. And I do wish it had more frame rates to work with, like super high speed. But, as a whole, and especially considering the price compared to many other cameras with such less diversity, THIS CAMERA ROCKS."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "I was looking for a new Canon body to upgrade from my trusty, old 300D (the original Digital Rebel). I was considering the 50D and was just about to buy it when the 7D was announced. I decided to wait and am glad I did. I was looking for a camera with fast, accurate autofocus and good low light performance, that would work well with the EF 24-70mm f/2.8L lens I mostly use. Slow autofocus (that sometimes gets 'lost') and noise as of ISO 400 were the main drawbacks of the 300D. The 7D is absolutely awesome in both departments. Even though I haven't even fully explored all AF settings and just started shooting straight away, focus is super quick and always spot on. At ISO 1600 you start to see some noise, but even at 3200, there is enough detail to apply noise reduction in post and be left with a sharp image. As for the other features: I've played with the video and the wireless flash a little bit so far. They seem to work as advertised: the HD images look better than those of my handheld Sony HDR-SR11, but that's not strange considering the $1k optics on the Canon. The 7D's microphone is pretty useless - not a surprise, either - but you can plug in an external one. I looked at all the specs, I read all the reviews of the 50D and the 7D, took a deep breath, sold the almost-factor-of-two-price to my wife and got the 7D.

I needed a camera with a higher level of quality in both the images and build. Immediately I was impressed with the 7D's ergonomics and high quality construction. After reading several reviews I elected to not purchase the kit lens (18-135mm) that normally comes with the camera due to mediocre quality throughout the zoom range. Instead I opted for prime lenses to start, and I have not been disappointed. The overall image quality has been superb. I would easily be able to enlarge the images to poster sized prints without degradation. My only problem with the camera is that there is no swivel LCD. As a nature photographer I love to capture images from different perspectives. Movable LCD's make that easier, but overall this is not a big problem."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Early days, but autofocus is excellent.

Despite having researched the 7D before it was even available, I still find myself being surprised and pleased that it has every feature I've needed and many more. The first thing I noticed about the camera is the size. It's bigger than the Rebel XT but not excessively large. It fits better in my hand and feels both more solid and more stable. The first thing I noticed when actually using the camera is the amazing LCD screen! You simply can't get any idea of how clear and vibrant this screen is without seeing it in person. I finally have faith that the on-camera screen will reveal if pictures are slightly out of focus or over-saturated. The screen is just one of the many parts of this camera that make it clear that this is a quality product. Even the sound of the shutter adds to the quality feel. This camera is great for people who aren't quite ready for a full-frame camera, but want many of the same features. If you're coming from a lower-end DSLR, the 8fps will astound you. You'll also be pleased to have such huge images to work with (5184x3456), but that does mean you'll probably want to get a bigger CF card (16GB or 32GB).

During the past nine months I have found it to be very reliable, relatively easy to use and able to produce very high quality images. After years of experience with the Canon 20D and 30D bodies, I found that I needed a camera capable of producing a larger digital image file (over 12 megapixels) and at 18 megapixels, the 7D was the obvious choice. Besides file size, image quality was my main concern and the 7D has performed very well in that regard. My only real complaint about the 7D's image quality is that it produces a certain amount of digital noise. I rarely shoot at ISO levels higher than 400, but even so the 7D has surprised me with the amount of noise it produces in smooth areas such as skies and especially if the smooth area needs any sort of exposure adjustment. The noise is certainly a result of the 7D's comparatively small sensor size and is easily dealt with using Noise Ninja. My other (minor) complaint is that the Mode dial should be a bit stiffer. I shoot almost exclusively in the Manual (M) mode but several times when I go to make an exposure I find that the dial has somehow shifted to Av (or sometimes B) mode and I have to reset it to M before continuing. Again, this is a minor, but somewhat annoying design fault.

To make things even easier, the 7D has a Q button, which allows the user to change every main setting on the camera through the LCD screen.

Highlights: The 7D's 8fps is incredible when you need the speed. In most situations I find myself using the normal (as opposed to high speed) multiple frame drive to avoid multiple exposures. (Having both options is a huge benefit.) The AF options are also great - I exclusively use the spot AF, but the other options may be a benefit for others. The customization of buttons is also superior to the 5DII. Low-light performance is excellent for this price point, though still 1 or 1.5 stops below the 5DII's full frame sensor. Shortcomings: The off-center AF points frequently miss with extremely short depth-of-field lenses (50mm f/1.2 and 135mm f/2.0 in my case). Ironically, they perform better with motion and AF Servo than with AF One Shot and static subjects. Micro calibration helped quite a bit, but the off-center points are still far less effective than the center point. Auto WB is also a bit finicky in tricky situations like hockey rinks.

With the C1, C2, and C3 user presets on the mode knob, you can dial in three different shooting scenarios exactly to your specs. I have C1 as an HDR mode, auto-bracketed aperture priority on a 2 second delay to minimize trigger press shake. C2 and C3 are 24p and 60p video modes, both M on different shutter speeds and ISO's.

While the 7D has a greater ISO range and many more custom settings, the real issues are low light shooting (I think the increase in pixel effects the quality of the 7D in low light creating more noise.) and the lack of information from Canon on the custom features such as the auto focus sensor arrangements. Since I do wildlife action photography for a living these two issues have produces many poor qulaity photos due to my lack of information during my learning curve with the camera. On the other hand, the 50D has a much simpler method of aiming on your subject and appears to handle low light more effectively. (I did not purchase 60D since Canon went to SD instead of Compact and my other equipment is Compact for versitility.) Of course the change in battery types was an additional expense, but hey Canon is like all other manufacturers when it comes to batteries. In short, Canon needs to produce a manual that has more information on the options within that product for those that are not into using an auto mode for taking pictures.

I was very close to getting the 5D mark ii, until I came across a review on it.

The 7D was much cheaper than the 5D mark ii\u00a0and still had a great ISO range, so I went with the 7D. So far I am very happy with my purchase. My images are very clear and in focus, which is, in my opinion, the best part of this camera. The ISO ranges from 100-12,800. The 12,800 is quite grainy and not something I would use on a regular basis, but the ISO is definitely better than the XTi. I don't notice too much grain until I start using ISO 1600. The HD video has been fun to use and I am definitely getting better videos than with my point and shoot camera. The thing I didn't realize before getting the 7D, is that it's hard to stay focused in video when your subject moves. You have to manually focus it, and it takes a lot of practice.

For photography the just downside is that the High end of ISO range (above 800) still presents color noise - not much different from 50D in this subject."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "I do some photo work periodically for a graphics design studio, shooting indoors without flash on location and outdoors for publications.

I began reading the reviews and articles concerning the 7D and was of course impressed by the 18mp sensor, not to mention the very reasonable price, but I was skeptical that it could perform at such claimed low noise level at high ISO and yet produce good resolution and image quality. I purchased one and recently tested it with a Canon 70-200/4, a very sharp L lens, at the Memorial Day Race for Daytona Prototypes and GT's at Limerock, CT. I shot handheld, having left the monopod in the car, at IS0 1000 at 200mm at a distance of about 200yds in sunny conditions. The resulting prints showed resolution and detail, especially of the sponsors' smaller graphics on the cars, that surpassed anything I had ever managed to get over the years, even using a tripod.

You still can't beat a full frame camera when it comes to low light/noise and better bokeh, but this is easily the best 1.6 crop out there. You can use this camera for just about anything, but it really shines if you like shooting sports, active kids, or wildlife b/c of the great tracking and auto-focus. If you are new to photography though, the feature set on this bad boy may be a bit overwhelming. My only minor complaints are that the camera doesn't come with a setting to keep auto ISO from going too high (currently will go as high as 3200), and also that the image quality can get a little noisy if you're a pixel peeper!

But I found that 7D's is quite good to me too. The auto focus is really nice. It's fast and accurate. The menu / interface is quite user friendly too. HD is cool but I don't think I will actually use it very often. I think from 50D to 7D, it's really a good upgrade (40D to 50D was not). The only thing I want to be picky about this 7D is the material Canon used in this body. I have a 40D, I feel very comfortable to grab it. But with 7D, when my hand is a bit warm, I feel a kind of sticky of the camera body and it never happened on 40D. Overall, the camera construction quality is great.

This is my 5th canon Body, and i will not lie, the best camera i've ever held in my hands. I've shot with a 5d Mk II, 1d Mk III, and other assortments of Canon and even Nikons, and this camera shines. The noise control is unbelieveable. My second body is a 40D and this thing makes my ISO 1600 look like ISO 400 on a 40D.

I worked with stills for over 10 years before moving into video 12 years ago. I loved the film look that I can achieve with this camera. The images are beautiful. I hope that in the future that Canon will make a professional video camera (xlr audio inputs, knee controls, adjustable viewfinder, etc.) that will use the larger CMOS that the Canons Still cameras are now using with the interchangeable still EOS Primes, and Zoom lenses. That will be a marriage made in Heaven. I used to shoot with only Nikon cameras (35mm film, just before digital started to come out) but I made the change and Canon now has my heart.

You still can use manual focus but for fast moving object, that's impossible.- ExpensiveThis is increadible camera for sport or wild life photography. but if you want to video your little kids (which's moving constantly), the 7D will disappoint you because its AF is useless. I hope Canon can improve it through firmware update"}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "I am an young indie film maker. I was originally saving up for the sony HDR-FX7 when a friend showed me the specs for this camera before it was released. I was very skeptical that a DSLR can handle video as well as prosumer camcorder until I saw the first videos. The shallow depth of field give this camera the look that most film makers look for. I also like the fact that it can shoot 60p video for smooth slow motion, even if it is only in 720p. I love how you handle the exposure more like an actual film camera instead of a video camera. I think 30p and 24p in 720p mode would have been really useful though. I would also like some more control with the audio. A headphone jack would have been great too. When using the on board mic for simple shooting, I get this weird almost clicking noise. I don't know if this is just my camera or the whole line. Writing all of this, I realize that very little has to do with stills. Sorry about that, but I am shooting video with it %90 of the time. The stills are awesome. The auto focus is lightning fast and almost always focuses on what I want. The stock lens that came with the kit isn't bad at all.I hope this helps."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "I work for a university where we are given 1D MarkIII's to shoot with. My personal gear has been a 40D and 50D both solid camera's but are NO WHERE near that of a 1D. So when I ordered the 7D I was looking for high ISO and the auto focus system 19 af points.

My job is now looking at buying new Mark IV's and giving a 7D as a second body....."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "On the whole the 7D is a great camera in every aspect. Excellent image quality; fast, accurate and responsive; rich in features (actually it has more features than the 5D ll) In most situations one can hardly find fault with this camera and in most situations it is just as good as the 5D mark ll. The obvious difference comes in extreme low light conditions such as theatre. I found it to struggle with noise from ISO 1600. Here it couldn't match the awesome power of the full frame. I just cannot understand why canon opted to cram 18 million pixels on a small sensor. 15 million would have been more than enough; and it would have given us even better IQ. It is the best camera in its class, but if you plan to shoot low light without flash, my advice is to go full frame."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "B", "raw-text": "I'm a free lance nature photography, and I love the results this camera as shown me so far.

I just returned from Egypt & Jordon where I had a chance to take still pictures and videos. The camera performed flawlessly and I was able to switch raidly between still photos (viewfinder and live view) and video. The auto ISO which ranges from 100 to 3200 was a help when visiting a dark temple - it kept me from forgetting to change the ISO back when returning outside. I also use the camera to film my granddaughter soccer games. The high burst speed of 8 fps is almost as fast as the EOS 1D series. The redesigned AF system is apparent with fewer missed shots. I believe this is the best SLR for the money."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "I love that this camera (with appropriate lenses) can quickly out perform our HVX's.

I had been researching and looking around for a new camera for a while. My old XSi is a very good starter DSLR but, for work, I needed something w/ more features and extended ISO. This camera, thus far, out of the box is amazing. Very responsive and lots of features. My only 'minor' gripes is the weight (very heavy esp w/ BG-E7 grip and my 24-70 lens) but will get use to it soon enough. The other is the daunting menus that seem to go on forever.

Quick focus and image transfer to CF is paramount to my job and both are met well with this camera."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "I really love this camera! From casual portraits to sports, and even video, this camera is definitely worth the investment.

The fast shutter speed is amazing and the way it feels so solid makes me know I've got quality in my hands. Yes, it's heavy but it balances out with the quality lens.

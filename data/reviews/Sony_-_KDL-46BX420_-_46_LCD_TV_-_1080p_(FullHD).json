[{"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: stunning picture quality for the priceCons: could use a couple more HDMI connectionsI purchased this TV to go along with my home theater setup. I have this hooked up with HDMI to my Denon AVR-1312. Then I hooked up my other HDMI stuff (Directv HD, Sony Blu-Ray and AppleTV) to the Denon receiver. Because I only needed this TV as part of a larger home theater setup, I don't care that it only has two HDMI inputs and doesn't connect to the internet. I use my Sony Blu-Ray and AppleTV to connect to the internet, so why do I need a TV for that? I needed something with a nice picture quality and this TV does it very well. The screen size is perfect for my family room. I LOVE this TV. For the price and quality, I must say.. buy this TV! It's a Sony, so you won't be disappointed."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: Pretty much everythingCons: NothingThe picture quality on this TV is amazing. The only adjustments I made was turning the sharpness from 15 to 17. Even though this TV is only 60Hz, the picture quality looks more like a 120Hz on it's lowest setting. Colors and tones are very true and life-like. For the price, I don't think this TV can be beat. It could use more than two HDMI connections, but with my Sony STR-DH520 made for blu-ray receiver, it wasn't an issue for me."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "ProsWe had been debating on what to buy and glad we went with the Sony. Awesome picture and colors and sound. Great HD quality. Easy to setup and get running (less than 10 minutes). Great deal with Dell, superfast shipping and great cutomer service. Lot of things I still haven't learned about the tv so I am sure I could write a better review in 2-3 months.ConsNothing bad about the tv. Granted we have only had it 3 weeks, but we couldnt be happier. The only thing I wish I would have done was to pick up another HDMI cable from Dell for the Sony Blue Ray Player."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: picture quality, sound, ease of set-upThis TV was a replacement for use in our bedroom. This TV is comparable in picture & sound to the Samsung in our living room. I've read other reviews which complained about the audio. I have no problems with the sound level produced by this product. The price I paid was incredible for the size and quality. I was happy to try a Sony at this price. I paid several hundred dollars more for the Samsung, but I can't see or hear a difference. This Sony does not have as many connections as the higher priced models, but I didn't need them for the room it is being used in. I would definitely recommend this to others."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: Great picture quality and easy to operateCons: The sound is good but with surround sound, it would be awesome!This is a great tv at a great price. This picture quality is great. The sound is good I think a surround sound system would make it perfect. I probalby need to do some adjusting, but the volume needs to be pretty high when watching movies to hear the voices. I am very pleased and satisfied with my purchase. I have always had good luck with Sony products."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: Easy to Setup, Great Picture, Good SoundCons: Only 2 HDMI inputsThis item had some positive and negative reviews, but I have a 52\" Sony from a few years ago that is similar that I love. This is easy to setup out of the box and has a great picture. I have another LCD that is a Vizio and the comparison is like apples and oranges. If you are going from an old analog TV you may not appreciate the superior picture because of the difference in technology. I was concerned about the 60hz (my other Sony is 120hz) but watching the last week of NFL games in HD and a couple of action movies I saw no issues with the picture quality. I don't have a BD player hooked up, so I can't speak to that use.Some reviewers complain about the sound. I have a home theater system in another room and if you are expecting that level of sound quality you will not get it. Having said that, the sound on the unit is more than adequate for the vast majority of users.The only flaw in this unit is having only 2 HDMI inputs. If all you want to connect a HD box and a blue ray player you're ok. But if you want to add a game system or other device you will be disappointed here.At $699 on sale, I think it's a steal. Hope this is helpful."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "the", "raw-text": "The KDL46BX420 is our primary TV. Since we did not need the more expensive bells and whistles, we opted for this unit.

To date, we have not encountered a single problem. Even with limited input ports, it can handle all of our needs - Cable TV, Blu-ray DVD, HD Camcorder, and various DV Camcorders."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "I needed a larger TV for my living room so purchased this one for my mantle.

My only problems with it are that there's quite a bit of dot crawl on my XBox 360, but that may be because it is a very old system (pre-HDMI) and the BluRay player (HDMI) is great, but I typically watch regular DVDs on there. So, really, I am not pushing this TV to it's full potential, which may be why I think the picture quality is great, but not blowing me away. The cable box I have hooked up to it (HDMI) has a great picture, but the channels typically come in in 720p or 1080i, so the 1080p is really only utilized by the 360 and BluRay.Other than my own subpar-hookup problems, I'd say the TV and picture are perfect. I'm not a sound guy, so I don't think I'd recognize the difference between the sound of two TVs (probably takes actual surround sound to get me to notice a difference).The features are great, the TV is great looking, and I would definitely buy this again and recommend it to a friend.Only incident I had was that the TV couldn't recognize my HDMI 2 plug, so I had to \"hard reset\" the TV (hold up on the remote and press the power button on the TV itself).

It worked just fine for about 14 months - long enough for the manufacturer warranty to expire. Then the problems began. Suddenly small pixelated lines appeared along the screen. Progressively increased until I had to contact a repair place to have it fixed - reputable, one which repairs all our hospital HD monitors. They diagnosed that the LCD display is broken. contacted Sony and they requested a Sony authorized facility to do the check up. Same result. Any further discussions with the SONY Customer support turned completely obsolete as their only statement was - out of warranty, your loss. What is shocking: 1. Change in Quality of SONY production - how can the display, most important and expensive part of the product, break in only 14 months?! This cannot be Sony product from the past - known for their excellent quality control and backing their production. 2. Customer support - arrogant (hanging up) and oblivious to the core of the issue - it is not just warranty vs. no warranty. It is about the quality they are known for. Overall, the final question remains are we taken for a ride by a big company which relies on past glory to push a mediocre product at exorbitant price?!

The black colors for this TV is way deeper than the Samsung and the sound system in this TV sounds way better than Samsung.Sound is the biggest differentiator between the Samsung vs Sony TVs in my opinion - Sony's sound is way better. Sony provides a more surround sound effect and has more bass and fuller sounds compared to the Samsung,This Samsung TV has more HDMI ports than the Sony though, 4 for Samsung vs only 2 for Sony. Not a big deal for me, but if you're plugging in a lot of devices to the TV then the Samsung might be better for you - for myself, i prefer a better picture and much better sound than having 2 extra hdmi ports."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "My wife and I will often just look at each other in amazement at the beauty of the picture on this television.

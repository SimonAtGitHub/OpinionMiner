It's a very fast and powerful phone! Where's the lag? Ha I laugh in the face of lag. Overall I've had a lot of phones, because I sell them! I came from a Samsung Captivate to this Atrix. I miss the screen on the Captivate. Thus giving the Atrix 4.5. I also have a Motorola droid X. The screen on the X seems to look more vibrant. The camera on the Atrix is best used in well lite areas such as outside in the day. However, I have just recently used it at a play. When setting it on night mode the camera performed very well for a cell phone. I would have to say that the HTC Inspire performs a bite better for camera use. The Atrix front facing camera is a bit grainy, but with less pixels in the front facing camera you can talk face to face with other front facing android users with less lag. Thus becoming independent from wifi for face to face chat. The Iphone's front facing camera is much nicer but useless outside of wifi. And the Atrix out performs the HTC Inspire's front facing camera due to the lack there of. lol Pros: FAST! Did I mention fast?! Powerful!

Gorilla glass is awesome, no need for cheesy, inhibiting screen protectors! The only thing I felt kind of cheap was the thin plastic battery cover. But a good case (Like Otterbox) will handle that.The phone is CRAZY fast. Yes, Motoblur (like Touchwiz on the Captivate) is laggy and annoying. Simply downloading the FREE LancherPro and setting it up really helps and you can truely customize it the way Android was ment to be. Using Ttitanium Backup to freeze and/or delete bloatware is easy and also frees space and speed things up more. After taking a few minutes to do this, I had everything set up how I wanted and was running lag free.The camera takes fairly good pictures and video, even in low light.

It was revolutionary a few years ago, but I feel the competition is passing them up! Well I decided to bite and I wanted to stick with ATT, so I did some research and to my surprise I find this phone which won the best of CES and it was coming to ATT!! I guess ATT needed something now that they aren't the exclusive iphone carrier. Well it was the best decision I ever made. I was a little worried that it was going to be too hard to use, but I think I found out why people say this misconception. There is so much more you can do with this OS than the iphone could ever do. It is endless, I never see myself getting bored because I can change whatever I want. I don't think it is anymore confusing than the iphone, because if you don't want to dive into all the OS can do you don't have to, it is only as difficult as you want it to be. The phone has an awesome video tutorial when you turn it on that helps tremendously. The phone has absolutely zero lag whatsoever just like my iphone which is always what I was worried about.

Can link with laptop dock and be rooted to give you full ubuntu exp from your phone.Cons: Wish battery life was longer but it last all day assuming you aren't running a playstation emulator or something that is heavy, advanced task killer is a must have app(Kind of a downfall with android that it doesn't automatically close programs even when you hit close) Wish it had the new 2gb or 4gb ram chip. Gets hot.The phone is by far amazing and I suggest definitely getting a screen protector and case right away although I dropped my phone a few times before getting a case and the gorilla glass on this phone is simply amazing and holds up well. Emulators play back wonderfully and the custom ginerbread rom from xda forums is almost a must so that you can hook your phone directly to your tv and do webtop over your tv. After which using an emulator you can full screen your mobile view on your phone and connect a wii mote and play with up to 4 of your friends essentially turning this into a portable gaming system.

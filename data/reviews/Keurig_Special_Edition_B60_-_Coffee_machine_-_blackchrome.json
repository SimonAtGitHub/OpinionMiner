It was easy to get brewing, just unpack, plug in, add water and K-cup and go. Gone are the wasted 8- and 10-cup pots when we really only need a couple for the two of us. I think my favorite feature is the clean up: there is no mess, just dispose of the K-cup.

I'm still trying to figure out which I like best. And you don't have to tie yourself to K-cups if you don't want, there's several filter cup devices out there that lets you put in your own grounds to make a cup. It's not quite as \"clean\", in that there's no grounds in the cup but there's some sediment that the wire filter lets through, but as long as you skip that last sip, you're ok and it ends up being a lot cheaper.I've even taken to using it for hot water for cup o' noodles or instant oatmeal.I'm ok with the water reserve size, but I wouldn't want anything smaller.

I don't mind it sitting out on my countertop and the machine doesn't take up that much room either. The 3 amount settings are nice to fit any preference of coffee strength. Personally, I use it to make hot chocolote and spiced chai lattes. I figure, we spend about $12/box of the 18 Kcups vs spending $4 per coffee at coffee houses.

I made this adjustment and have never had a problem since! It is definitely more cost effective to use this product with your own ground coffee rather than the disposable k-cups. I do think that Keurig should either make a design adjustment to the brewer or the My K-cup to correct this issue, though. I would also recommend to any that plan to use this frequently that you consider purchasing the 2 pack of additional filter baskets so that you are able to make multiple cups without having to clean the filter after each use."}, {"rating": "5", "user": "-", "raw-text": "Pros: easy to use; quick; brews quickly; great tasteCons: a bit more expensive but worth it!; K-cups are expensiveThe Keurig B60 is a top-of-the-line system for coffee-making. Many people have had coffee makers in their lives, and I was one of the, but nothing really compares at all to the Keurig B60. It stands shoulders apart from any other coffee maker, even others in the Keurig line. First off, this coffee maker is extremely intuitive and easy to use. It brews your coffee evenly and quickly, and, most importantly, the coffee itself tastes absolutely great. The downsides really are the price and the single serving (although that's not a downside for everyone). You will have to shell out some money for the coffee maker and the K-Cups over time, but when you consider how much the same coffee would cost at any shop or cafe, you will be glad you did.

The K cups run about 50 cents each, depending on where you buy, and usually come in boxes of 18, 24, or even 50. Brands for k-cups include Green Mountain Coffee, Donut House, Gloria Jean's and other reputable coffee makers, and the k-cups branch out to not just coffee, but tea and cocoa as well.The Kuerig is very easy to set up and use- it takes less than 5 mins to set up.

We purchased a Keurig B60 this time around (the B70 was way out of our price range), and we couldn't be happier. The B60 has three cups levels instead of the B40's two. It also offered us the ability to determine the temperature of the brew. We still get the timer on, off, etc., but the temperature of the brew? This feature is beneficial if you have children in the house who wants to make their own tea or hot chocolate. You don't have to worry about them burning themselves with hot liquid. I do wish that this model came with a filter. You have to make sure you don't have hard water or well water when using this without the filter otherwise it will clog and will not work for long.

We recently purchased a new one because our original one wasn't brewing the cups size correctly. It lasted us for 4 years though. The new one that we purchased a month ago seems to be mechanically different so I will base my review on the new one.This single cup brewer makes great coffee in very little time. Its easy to use (my 2 year old makes our coffee from putting the K-Cup in, closing it, to brewing it), very convenient, and multifunctional. It requires K-Cups (pre-packaged ground single serving coffee pods) but you can find them at almost any store now, and using coupons and buying in bulk makes the cost better.Not only do you get great hot coffee one cup at a time, but you can also use it to get hot water for oatmeal or stick in a bouillon cube and you have soup.You can also make iced tea with the tea K-Cups by brewing over a cup of ice.

I knew I would be very critical of the unit given it's price but this has reinvented coffee for me. I leave the unit on and it prepares a cup quicker than I can decide on which type of coffee I want to have. The unit feels very solid and operates perfectly but I purchased the extended warranty just in case something messes up with it. The selection of coffee / tea is very extensive but fortunately my unit had a variety pack so I could try different ones without having to purchase a box that I might not like. I have found that some of the flavored coffees have the flavor either too weak or too strong depending on the cup size I select to brew. If you think the price of one of the units is too much, consider what you may be paying at a retail coffee store because the freshness / quality of the k-cups will make you think you have a $4 coffee in your hand.

The only drawback is trying to get the coffee grounds cleaned out of it each time, but that does not deter me from using it. I can use my favorite coffee without the added cost of the single user container, which I simply refused to spend the extra money on. My boyfriend saw this online and actually checked in several stores to find it for me. This filter is the only reason he purchased the coffee maker, so this was a great idea for Keurig to come up with.

Another thing I appreciate about the Keurig Special Edition Brewing System is the variety of coffees and teas that can be brewed. There is something for everyone, even those who don't like coffee.However, the Keurig is a bit pricey. The pods are quite a bit more expensive than brewing the old-fashioned way. That being said, the Keurig is much more economical than going to your local coffee shop. So I guess the price all depends on your point of reference.

Not only does this machine provide perfect single servings, but it is also really easy to use. The K-cups come in a variety of flavors so everyone can enjoy what they want. However, I recommend buying the K-cup filter that lets you use your own ground coffee because it will cost a lot less, but still taste great. Cleaning is also not a hassle since there aren't any parts that really need to be cleaned except for emptying out the excess liquid collector once in a while. It heats up quickly and brew time is also fast. It's also nice to be able to set when the machine is on and off and the brew temperature.

I had my coffeemaker registered over the phone so there was no need to mail in the warranty card. The design is very modern and stands out, especially the blue LED lights. A few problems I found with this coffeemaker is that I couldn't find the K-Cups to make coffee on the go. I sometimes had to take some from work just to feed my habit. I later found that amazon.com sell K-Cups super cheap so now that's where I buy all my coffee from. I recommend buying a variety of K-Cups since the come in bulk.

Here goes: I happened to find a great deal on the Keurig b60 that I couldn't pass up, so rather than wait to see whether or not I would get it for Christmas, I went ahead and bought it and set it up pretty much as soon as I had gotten home. This unit is extremely use to use and no mess to clean up. I do wish that the large mug size would brew a little more coffee, but I think they take into consideration that you may be adding cream to your coffee and allow room in your mug for that. For those of you on the fence about buying this, it really depends on the cost factor. While this is definitely cheaper per cup vs going to a local donut shop, it is more expensive than using a traditional coffee machine. The thing that I found though (with me anyway) is that even though using a tradtional coffee machine was cheaper, I was still wasting money simply because I'd brew an entire pot and would end up tossing half of it, if neither me nor my husband drank the whole thing. With this system you brew\u00a01 cup at a time, so there is no waste.

Two of my friends had them, and they were both very happy. Both friends were so excited to be \"early adopters\" of this new brewing system and they each insisted on giving me a nice demonstration and coffee tasting session. It was very impressive, and in October 2006, I decided to invest in one of my own. We've been so happy with our Keurig, and even more so as the new varieties of K-Cups appeared on the market. We even purchased FOUR more Keurig B60's for friends and family for holiday gifts over the years. Everyone we have given it to has been so grateful, and the best part is we can give them future gifts of K-cups for birthdays and holidays. The Keurig is easy to use, the K-cups are readily available in grocery stores and on-line, and the coffee tastes terrific! It's saved my countless trips to Dunkin Donuts, with a cup that is just a delicious. There's no waste, since you don't need to brew a whole pot for just one or two cups. The coffee brews at a nice hot temperature, which can be adjusted to taste. You must remember to descale the Keurig every 6 months or so, or you could end up with a blocked water supply, like we did.

We have sampled everything from tea, to hot chocolate, to exotic blends and haven't found anything we didn't really like.The drawback is that the k-cups can be a little pricey if you drink as much coffee as we do in our household.

Usually you can by 18 kcups for 10.00 at Target, Bed Bath & Beyond etc.The personal k-cup is also a good investment to allow you to put your own blend into the k-cup.

I also liked the speed - coffee in only 30 seconds, brewed fresh and steaming hot!I researched the various one-cup systems and kept seeing rave reviews for the Keurig. I priced them out and found the best deal at Costco, mainly because it included an extra-large supply of the individual servings, or \"K-cups.\" Brought it home, plugged it in, filled the reservoir with water, and read the instructions.Using the Keurig really is easy. You simply lift a handle to expose a place that holds one individual serving of coffee grounds, which Keurig calls \"K-cups.\" They are conveniently packaged in containers about twice as big, and almost the same shape as, those tiny Coffeemate creamer cups. Set the K-cup in the holder, lower the handle, and select your serving size (basically small, medium, or large). And make sure your coffee mug is in place to catch the hot coffee that steams out underneath.

See, the problem with traditional coffee machines, besides wasting leftover coffee, is that he likes his coffee strong enough to put hairs on his chest, and I like mine more \"normal\"...like what you would get at a restaurant with breakfast.This machine allows him to make his coffee more concentrated and me to have mine how I like it...just with a one-touch button. The bottom tray comes off easily if you want to make coffee for your tall travel mug.

You have to pour your ground coffee into the little mesh filter, put the mesh filter into the plastic cone, and then put it in your Keurig. Sounds simple, but if you want to brew another cup, you have to remove the reusable filter, empty out the used grounds, wash the filter, add more ground coffee and do it all over again.

The convenience is great. you can either use kcups or you can buy a filter system to use your own coffee brand. I've used both and there both very easy to use. the nice thing is you brew one cup at a time which means no burnt coffee because it won;t sit for hours. If your like me I don;t make it through a pot of coffee before it gets burnt! I enjoy the 3 different cup sizes so you can choose what size cup, which strength of brew. they have a 3.5 oz cup for stronger brews, 8.5 oz cup for regular brews and 10 oz cup for travel size. I like to use the 3.5 oz cup because I like an extra strong cup of coffee. the ease of filling the water reservoir is great you can fill it with a cup or you can remove it and fill it under your faucet, and there is a blue light that flashes when you need to refill. everything is one touch and simple to use.

It is only noisy when drawing water from the resovoir, which isn't that loud. I do wish the 9.25 oz was the standard size that k cups were measured for as this size is closest to standard ceramic coffee cups.The B 60 is still a wonderfull machine. I use it everday and all day. I still keep my Capresso coffee maker for when several people are coming over. I have tried many of the coffee brands so far and prefer bold coffee as I use the 9.25oz setting. The best thing is getting out of bed and dropping a kcup in and in about 40 seconds my first cup of the day, which beats the standard coffee pot of preparing and making, which usually takes 10-15 minutes.

I love the coffee maker - it's quick, convenient, and perfect for my fiance and I to use - but we weren't able to buy the K-Cups very often due to price. While shopping in Target one day, looking at the varieties of K-Cups, we noticed this. At first I didn't know what it was, but when I figured it out, i was so happy! This is extremely convenient. Rather than spend the ten dollars on a pack of 18 cups of coffee, we could spend just five more to get the reusable filter. We had some coffee grounds at home, and were excited to try it. It works wonderfully! The switch-out was easy. The My K-Cup filter is easy to use (you can just scoop up coffee grounds). It is also very easy to clean.

I have been telling all my friends who are coffee lovers to go and buy themselves a Keurig. I have reviewed every single-cup brew system and found Keurig to be the best on the market! The K cups offer a fresh cup every single time and you can make a hot cup of fresh coffee in seconds! If your unit is off, it only takes less then a minute to heat the water. The Keurig system is by far the most popular which means K cups are sold at every major retailer... you won't have to go searching for them or worry about only finding them at out of the way stores. The two best features, in my opinion, about the Keurig system: My K-cup and the Variety of K cups offered (even Caribou!!!). The My K-cup allows you to use any type of fine grind coffee so you are not limited to just using what the k cup line offers. That being said, the K cup line is AWESOME!!! There are so many different kinds and flavors, cocoas and teas... you can have something for everyone. A lot of people think it is expensive, however you can get the my k cup and use regular coffee and have k cups on hand too.

The k-cups are a bit expensive but that's what you get for convenience. It would be nice if there was a setting to ajdust the quantity of water for each cup size.While the cup sizes could be better, if you use large coffee cups as I do you can always brew one on large and run another threw on small. If the cup can't quite hold both I just move another cup under to catch the remaining amount.

We all have different schedules when we like to have our coffee so brewing a whole pot and having it sit in the kitchen was not ideal, while brewing just one cup is very time consuming, so we decided to try the Keurig brewing system. This system works well if you want fresh coffee and want it quick. It's very easy to use and you are in and out within minutes. The best part about this device is that there is very little cleaning that needs to be done, which is perfect for an office or a lazy person at home. The knock I have against it is that you are limited to the selection of coffee offered in K-Cups which are lot more pricier. They do have an adaptor that allows you to use your own coffee grounds but then that is defeating the purpose of using this system for it's simplicity.

Since you aren't making coffee for so many people, it is that much faster.
